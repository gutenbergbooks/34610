<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Are you musical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I neither play nor sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Your answer shows a complete misunderstanding
of the case. Because you neither play nor
sing, it by no means follows that you are unmusical.
If you love music and appreciate it, you may be more
musical than many pianists or singers; and certainly
you may become so.</p>
<p>This book is planned for the lover of music, for
those who throng the concert and recital halls and the
opera&mdash;those who have not followed music as a profession,
and yet love it as an art; who may not play
or sing, and yet are musical. Among these is an ever-growing
number that &ldquo;wants to know,&rdquo; that no longer
is satisfied simply with allowing music to play upon
the senses and the emotions, but wants to understand
why it does so.</p>
<p>To satisfy this natural desire which, with many,
amounts to a craving or even a passion, and to do so
in wholly untechnical language and in a manner that
shall be intelligible to the average reader, is the purpose
of this book. In carrying it out I have not neglected
the personal side of music, but have endeavored
to keep clearly before the eyes of the reader, and in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
their proper sequence, the great names in musical history.</p>
<p>I am somewhat of a radical in my musical opinions,
one of those persons of advanced views who does not
lift his eyes reverentially heavenward every time the
words &ldquo;symphony&rdquo; and &ldquo;sonata&rdquo; are mentioned. In
fact, I am most in sympathy with the liberating tendencies
of modern music, which lays more stress upon
the expression of life and truth than upon the exact
form in which these are sought to be expressed. Nevertheless,
I am quite aware that only through the
gradual development and expansion of forms that now
may be growing obsolete has music achieved its emancipation
from the tyranny of form. Therefore, while
I would rather listen to a Wagner music-drama than
to a Mozart opera, or might go to more trouble to
hear a Richard Strauss tone poem than a Beethoven
symphony, I am not such an unconscionable heretic as
to be unaware of the great, the very great part played
by the Mozart opera and the Beethoven symphony in
the evolution of music, or their importance in the orderly
and systematic study of the art. Indeed, I was
brought up on &ldquo;Don Giovanni,&rdquo; the Fifth Symphony
and the Sonatas before I brought myself up on Chopin,
Liszt (for whom I have far greater admiration than
most critics), and Wagner. Therefore, an ample portion
of this book will be found devoted to the classical
epoch and its great masters, especially its greatest
master, Beethoven, and to the forms in which they
worked. Nor do I think that these pages will be found
written unsympathetically. But something is due the
great body of music-lovers who, being told that they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span>
<em>must</em> admire this, that and the other classical composer,
<em>because he is classical</em>, find themselves at a loss
and think themselves to blame because modern music
makes a more vivid and deeper impression upon them.
If they only knew it&mdash;they are in the right! But they
have needed some one to tell them so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advanced,&rdquo; this book is. But plenty will be found
in it regarding the sonata and the symphony, and,
through the latter, the development of the orchestra;
and orchestral instruments, their tone quality, scope
and purpose are described and explained.</p>
<p>More, perhaps, than in any work with the same purpose,
the great part played by the pianoforte in the
evolution of music is here recognized, and I have
availed myself of the opportunity to tell much of the
story of that evolution in connection with this, the
most popular of musical instruments, and its great
masters. Why the greater freedom of technique and
expression made possible by the modern instrument
has caused the classical sonata to be superseded by the
more romantic works of Chopin and others whose compositions
are typically pianistic, and how these works
differ in form and substance from those of the classicists,
are among the many points made clear in these
chapters.</p>
<p>The same care has been bestowed upon that portion
of the book relating to vocal music&mdash;to songs, opera,
music-drama and oratorio. In fact, the aim has been
to equip the lover of music&mdash;that is, of good music of
all kinds&mdash;with the knowledge which will enable him
to enjoy far more than before either an orchestral concert,
a piano or song recital, an opera or a music-drama&mdash;anything,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
in fact, in music from Bach to Richard
Strauss; to place everything before him from the
standpoint of a writer who is himself a lover of music
and who, although thoroughly in sympathy with the
more advanced schools of the art, also appreciates the
great masters of the past and is behind none in acknowledging
what they contributed to make music
what it is.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you musical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I neither play nor sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, if you can read and listen, there is no reason
why you should not be more musical&mdash;a more genuine
lover of music&mdash;than many of those whose musicianship
lies merely in their fingers or vocal cords. Try!</p>

<h2>I</h2>
<h3>THE PIANOFORTE</h3>
</div>
<p>There must be practically on the part of every
one who attends a pianoforte recital some degree
of curiosity regarding the instrument itself.
Therefore, it seems to me pertinent to institute at
the very outset an inquiry into what the pianoforte is
and how it became what it is&mdash;the most practical, most
expressive and most universal of musical instruments,
the instrument of the concert hall and of the intimate
home circle. Knowledge of such things surely will enhance
the enjoyment of a pianoforte recital&mdash;should be,
in fact, a prerequisite to it.</p>
<p>The pianoforte is the most used and, for that very
reason, perhaps, the most abused of musical instruments.
Even its real name generally is denied it. Most
people call it a piano, although <i>piano</i> is a musical term
denoting a degree of sound, soft, gentle, low&mdash;the opposite
of <i>forte</i>, which means strong and loud. The
combination of the two terms in one word, pianoforte,
signifies that the instrument is capable of being played
both softly and loudly&mdash;both <i>piano</i> and <i>forte</i>. It was
this capacity that distinguished it from its immediate
precursors, the old-time harpsichords and clavichords.
One of the first requirements in learning how to understand
music is to learn to call things musical by their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
right names. To speak of a pianoforte as a piano is
one of our unjustifiable modern shortcuts of speech,
a characteristic specimen of linguistic laziness and evidence
of utter ignorance concerning the origin and
character of the instrument.</p>
<p>If I were asked to express in a single phrase the
importance of this instrument in the musical life of
to-day I would say that the pianoforte is the orchestra
of the home. Indeed, the title of the familiar song
&ldquo;What Is Home Without a Mother?&rdquo; might, without
any undue stretch of imagination, be changed to &ldquo;What
Is Home Without a Pianoforte?&rdquo;&mdash;although, if you are
working hard at your music and practicing scales and
finger exercises several hours a day, it might be wiser
not to ask your neighbor&rsquo;s opinion on this point.</p>
<h4>The King of Instruments.</h4>
<p>&ldquo;In households where there is no pianoforte we seem
to breathe a foreign atmosphere,&rdquo; says Oscar Bie, in
his history of the instrument and its players; and he
adds with perfect truth that it has become an essential
part of our life, giving its form to our whole musical
culture and stamping its characteristics upon our whole
conception of music. Surely out of every ten musical
persons, layman or professional, at least nine almost
invariably have received their first introduction to
music through the pianoforte and have derived the
greater part of their musical knowledge from it. Even
composers like Wagner and Meyerbeer, whose work
is wholly associated with opera, had their first lessons
in music on the pianoforte, and Meyerbeer achieved
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
brilliant triumphs as a concert pianist before he turned
his attention to the operatic stage.</p>
<p>Of all musical instruments the pianoforte is the most
intimate and at the same time the most public&mdash;&ldquo;the
favorite of the lonely mourner and of the solitary soul
whose joy seeks expression&rdquo; and the tie that unites the
circle of family and friends. Yet it also thrills the
great audience of the concert hall and rouses it to the
highest pitch of enthusiasm. It is the king of instruments,
and the reason for its supremacy is not far to
seek. Weitzmann, the author of the first comprehensive
account of the pianoforte and its literature, speaks
of its ability &ldquo;to lend living expression to all phases
of emotion for which language lacks words&rdquo;; its full,
resonant tone; its volume vying with that of the orchestra;
its command of every shade of sound from the
gentlest <i>pianissimo</i> to the most powerful <i>forte</i>; and its
mechanism, which permits of the most rapid runs and
passages, and at the same time of sustained singing
notes and phrases.</p>
<h4>Music Under One&rsquo;s Fingers.</h4>
<p>But this is not all. There is an overture by Weber
entitled &ldquo;The Ruler of the Spirits.&rdquo; Well, he who
commands the row of white and black keys is ruler of
the spirits of music. He has music, all that music can
give, within the grasp of his two hands, under his ten
fingers. The pianoforte can render anything in music.
Besides music of its own, it can reproduce the orchestra
or the voice with even greater fidelity than the
finest engraving renders a painting; for only to the eyes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
of one familiar with the painting does the engraving
suggest the color scheme of the original, whereas,
through certain nuances of technique that are more
easily felt than described, the pianoforte virtuoso who
is playing an arrangement of an orchestra composition
can make his audience hear certain instruments of the
orchestra&mdash;even such characteristic effects as the far-carrying
pizzicato, or the rumbling of the double basses
or their low growl; the hollow, reverberating percussions
of the tympani; sustained notes on the horns; the
majestic accents of trombones; the sharp shrill of piccolos;
while some of the most effective pianoforte pieces
are arrangements of songs.</p>
<p>Moreover, there are pianoforte compositions like the
Hungarian rhapsodies of Liszt which, while conceived
and carried out in the true spirit of the instrument
(&ldquo;pianistic,&rdquo; as they say), yet suggest the tone colors
of the orchestra without permitting these to obtrude
themselves too much. This is one of the many services
of Liszt, the giant of virtuosos and a giant among composers,
to his art. It has been said that Liszt played
the whole orchestra on the pianoforte. He did even
more. He developed the technique of the instrument
to such a point that the suggestion of many of the
clang tints of the orchestra has become part of its heritage.
This dual capacity of the pianoforte, the fact
that it has a tone quality wholly peculiar to itself, so
that when, for example, we are playing Chopin we
never think of the orchestra, while at the same time it
can take up into itself and reproduce, or at least suggest,
the tone colors of other instruments, is one of its most
remarkable characteristics.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></div>
<p>Quite as remarkable and as interesting and important
is the circumstance that these tone tints are
wholly dependent upon the player. There is nothing
peculiar to the make of the strings, the sounding-board,
the hammers, that tends to produce these
effects. They are due wholly to the player&rsquo;s
subtle manipulation of the keys, so that we get the
added thrill of the virtuoso&rsquo;s personal magnetism. The
pianoforte owes much of its popularity, much of its
supremacy, to the fact that a player&rsquo;s interpretation of
a composition cannot be marred by any one but himself.
It rests in his hands alone, whereas the conductor
of an orchestra is dependent upon a hundred players,
some of whom may have no more soul than so many
wooden Indians. Even supposing a conductor to be
gifted with a highly poetic and musically sensitive nature,
it is impossible that so many men of varying degrees
of temperament as go to make up an orchestra,
and none of them probably a virtuoso of the highest
rank, will be as sympathetically responsive to his baton
as a pianoforte is to the fingers of a musical poet like
Paderewski; for the fingers of a great virtuoso are the
ambassadors of his soul.</p>
<h4>Melody and Accompaniment on One Instrument.</h4>
<p>This personal, one-man control of the instrument has
been of inestimable value to the pianoforte in establishing
itself in its present unassailable position. Moreover,
in controlling it the pianist commands all the resources
of music. With his two thumbs alone he can
accomplish what no player upon any other instrument
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
in common use is capable of doing with all ten fingers.
He can sound together the lowest and the highest notes
in music, for all the notes of music as we know it simply
await the pressure of the fingers upon the keys of
the pianoforte. It is the one instrument capable of
power as well as of sweetness and grace which
places the whole range of harmony and counterpoint
at the disposal of one player. A vocalist can sing an
air, but can you imagine a vocalist singing through an
entire programme without accompaniment? After half
a dozen unaccompanied songs the singing even of the
greatest prima donna would become monotonous for
lack of harmony. The violin and violoncello, next to
the pianoforte the most frequently heard instruments
in the concert hall, labor under the same disadvantage
as the singer. They are dependent upon the accompaniment
of others.</p>
<p>The pianist, on the other hand, has the inestimable
advantage of being able to play melody and accompaniment
on one instrument at the same time&mdash;all in
one. While singing with some of his fingers the tender
melodic phrase of a Chopin nocturne, he completes with
the others the exquisite weave of harmony, and reveals
the musical fabric to us in all its beauty. Moreover, it
is the pianist himself who does this, not some one else
at his signal, which the intermediary possibly may not
wholly understand. When Paderewski is at the pianoforte
we hear Paderewski&mdash;not some one else of a less
sensitive temperament whom he is directing with a
baton. A poet is at the instrument and we hear the
poet. A poet may be at the conductor&rsquo;s desk&mdash;but in
the orchestra that is required for the interpretation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
of his musical conceptions poets usually are conspicuous
by their absence. Even great singers suffer because
their accompaniments are apt not to be as sensitive of
temperament as they are; and it is a fact that the grace
and beauty of Schubert&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hark, Hark, the Lark&rdquo; never
have been so fully revealed to me by a singer as by
Paderewski&rsquo;s playing of Liszt&rsquo;s arrangement of the
song, because the pianist is able to shade the accompaniment
to the most delicate nuances of the melody.
How delightful, too, it is to go through the pianoforte
score of a Wagner music-drama and, as you play the
wonderful music&mdash;all placed within the grasp of your
ten fingers&mdash;watch the scenic pictures and the action
pass in imagination before your eyes in your own music
room without the defects inseparable from every public
performance, because the success of a performance depends
upon the co-operation of so many who do not
co-operate. Yes, the pianoforte is the king of instruments
because it is the most independent of instruments
and because it makes him who plays upon it independent.</p>
<h4>Music&rsquo;s Debt to the Pianoforte.</h4>
<p>It would be difficult to overestimate the debt that
music owes to the pianoforte. Including for the present
under this one name the various keyboard instruments
from which it was developed, the sonata form
had its first tentative beginnings upon it and was
wrought out to perfection through it by a process of
gradual evolution extending from Domenico Scarlatti
through Bach&rsquo;s son, Philipp Emanuel Bach, to Beethoven.
As a symphony simply is a sonata for orchestra,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
it follows that through the sonata and thus through the
pianoforte the form in which the classical composers
cast their greatest works was established. Richard
Strauss, in his revision of Berlioz&rsquo;s book on orchestration,
even goes so far as to assert that Beethoven, and
after him Schumann and Brahms, treated the orchestra
pianistically; but the discussion of this point is better
deferred until we take up the orchestra and orchestral
music.</p>
<p>Here, however, it may be observed that in addition
to its constant use as an instrument for the concert hall
and the home, and for the delight of great audiences
and the joy of the amateur player and his familiar
circle, many of the great composers, even when writing
orchestral works, have used the pianoforte for their
first sketches, testing their harmonies on it, and often,
no doubt, while groping over the keys in search of the
psychical note, hit upon accidental improvements
and new harmonies. Even Wagner, who understood
the orchestra as none other ever has, employed the
pianoforte in sketching out his ideas. &ldquo;I went to my
Erard and wrote out the passage as rapidly as if I had
it by heart,&rdquo; he writes from Venice to Mathilde <a name='TC_1'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Wesendonk'">Wesendonck</ins>,
in relating to her the genesis of the great love
duet in &ldquo;Tristan und Isolde,&rdquo; and I could quote other
passages from my &ldquo;Wagner and his Isolde,&rdquo; which is
based on the romantic passages in the lives of the composer
and the woman who inspired his great music-drama,
to show the frequency with which he made similar
use of the universal musical instrument.</p>
<p>The pianoforte has in many other ways been a boon
to some of the most famous composers. Many of them
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
were pianists, and by public performances of their own
works materially accelerated the appreciation of their
music. Mozart was a youthful prodigy, and later a
virtuoso of the highest rank. Beethoven, before he
was overtaken by deafness, introduced his own pianoforte
compositions to the public and was the musical
lion of the Viennese drawing-rooms. Mendelssohn was
a pianist of the same smooth, affable, gentlemanly type
as his music. Chopin was not a miscellaneous concert
player&mdash;his nature was too shrinking; but at the
Salon Pleyel in Paris he gave recitals to the musical
élite, who in turn conveyed his ideas to the greater
public. Schumann began his musical career as a virtuoso,
but strained the fourth finger of his right hand
in using a mechanical apparatus which he had devised
for facilitating the practice of finger exercises. His
wife, Clara Wieck, however, who was the most
famous woman pianist of her time, substituted her
fingers for his. Liszt literally hewed out the way for
his works on the keyboard. Brahms was a pianist of
solid, scholarly attainments. In fact, dig where you
will in musical soil, you strike the roots of the pianoforte.</p>
<h4>Its Lowly Origin.</h4>
<p>It must not be supposed, however, that the instrument
as we know it attained to its present supremacy
except through a long process of evolution. One of
the immediate precursors of the modern pianoforte was
the harpsichord, a name suggesting that the instrument
was a harp with a keyboard attachment, and such,
in a general way, the pianoforte is. But the harp is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
a very fully developed affair compared with the mean
little apparatus in which lay and was discovered many
centuries ago the first germ of the king among instruments.
This was the monochord, and it has required
about nine centuries for the evolution of an instrument
consisting of a single string set in vibration by means
of a keyboard attachment into the modern pianoforte.
But do not be alarmed. I am not about to give a nine
hundred years&rsquo; history of the pianoforte. Such detailed
consideration would belong to a technical work
on the manufacture of the instrument and would be out
of place here. Something of its history should, however,
be known to every one who wants to understand
music, but I shall endeavor to be as brief and at the
same time as clear as possible.</p>
<p>The monochord originally was used much as we use
a tuning fork, to determine true musical pitch. If you
take a short piece of string, tie one end of it fast, draw
it taut and pluck it, its vibrations will sound a note. If
you grasp the string and draw it taut from nearer to
the point where it is tied, you shorten what is called
the &ldquo;node,&rdquo; increase the number of vibrations and produce
a higher note. The monochord in its simplest
form consisted of a string drawn taut over an oblong
box and tuned to a given pitch by means of a peg.
Under the string and in contact with it was a bridge
or fret that could be moved by hand along a graduated
scale marked on the bottom of the box. By moving the
bridge the node of the string could be shortened and
the notes marked at corresponding points on the graduated
scale produced. After a while, and in order to
facilitate the study of the harmonious relationship between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span>
different notes, three strings were added, each
with its bridge and graduated scale.</p>
<p>It was more or less of a nuisance, however, to continually
shift four bridges to as many different
points under the four strings. As an improvement
upon this awkward arrangement some
clever person conceived about the beginning of
the tenth century, the idea of borrowing the
keyboard from the organ and attaching it to the
monochord. To the rear end of each key was attached
an upright piece called a tangent. When the finger
pressed upon a key the tangent struck one of the strings,
set it in vibration, and at the same time, by contact,
created a node which lasted as long as the key was kept
down and the tangent remained pressed against the
string. To increase the utility of the instrument by
adding more strings and more keys was the next obvious
step, and gradually the monochord ceased to be
a mere technical apparatus for the determining of pitch
and became an instrument on which professionals and
amateurs could play with pleasure to themselves and
others.</p>
<h4>A Poet&rsquo;s Advice to His Musical Daughter.</h4>
<p>There has been preserved to us from about the year
1529 a reply made by the poet Pietro Bembo to his
daughter Elena, who had written to him from the convent
where she was being educated asking if she could
have lessons upon the monochord, which seems to have
been as popular in its day as its fully developed successor,
the modern pianoforte, is now.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Touching thy request for permission to play upon
the monochord,&rdquo; begins Bembo&rsquo;s quaint answer, &ldquo;I reply
that because of thy tender years thou canst not
know that playing is an art for vain and frivolous
women, whereas I would that thou shouldst be the most
chaste and modest maiden alive. Besides, if thou wert
to play badly it would cause thee little pleasure and no
little shame. Yet in order to play well thou must needs
give up from ten to twelve years to the exercise, without
so much as thinking of aught else. How far this
would benefit thee thou canst see for thyself without
my telling thee. But thy schoolmates, if they desire
thee to learn to play for their pleasure, tell them thou
dost not care to have them laugh at thy mortification.
Therefore, content thyself with the pursuit of the sciences
and the practice of needlework.&rdquo; These words
of the poet Bembo to his daughter Elena&mdash;are they
so wholly lacking in application to our own day? And
I wonder&mdash;did or did not Elena learn to play the monochord?
If not, it was because she lived a few centuries
too soon. She would have had her own way to-day!</p>
<h4>The Clavichord.</h4>
<p>Monochord means &ldquo;one string,&rdquo; and the application
of the term to the instrument after other strings had
been added was a misnomer. The monochord on which
Elena, to the evident distress of her distinguished parent,
desired to play, really was a clavichord, which was
derived directly from the primitive monochord.</p>
<p>If you will raise the lid of your pianoforte you will
find that the strings become shorter from the bass up,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
the lowest note being sounded by the longest, the highest
note by the shortest string; for the longer the
string the slower the vibrations and the deeper the
sounds produced, and <i>vice versa</i>. This principle is so
obvious that it seems as if it must have been applied
to the clavichord almost immediately and a separate
string provided for each key. But for many years the
strings of the clavichord continued all of equal length,
and three or four neighboring keys struck the same
string, so that the contact of the upright tangent with
the string not only set the latter in vibration but also
served to form the node which produced the desired
note. Not until after the clavichord had been in
use several centuries, were its strings made of
varying length and a separate string assigned to each
key. These new clavichords were called <i>bundfrei</i>
(fret-free or tangent-free) because the node of each
string was determined by that string&rsquo;s length and not
by the contact of the tangent.</p>
<p>The clavichord retained the box shape of its prototype,
the monochord. Originally it was portable and
was set upon a table; later, however, was made, so to
speak, to stand upon its own legs. In appearance it
resembled our square pianofortes. It gave forth a
sweet, gentle and decidedly pretty musical sound. It
had a further admirable quality in its capacity for sustaining
a tone, since by keeping the tangent pressed
against the string the player was able to sustain the
tone so long as the string continued to vibrate. Moreover,
by holding down the key and at the same time
making a gentle rocking motion with the finger he was
able to produce a tremolo effect which German musicians
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span>
called <i>Bebung</i> (trembling), and the French <i>balancement</i>.</p>
<p>A defect of the clavichord was, however, its lack of
power. This defect led to experiments which resulted
in the construction of a keyboard instrument the strings
of which, in response to the action of the keys, were
set in vibration by jacks tipped with crow-quills or
hard leather. The sound was much stronger than that
of the clavichord. But the jacks twanged the strings
with uniform power, &ldquo;permitting a sharp outline, but
no shading of the tones.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The Harpsichord.</h4>
<p>If you chance to be listening to a Hungarian band
at a restaurant you may notice that one of the players
has lying on a table before him an instrument with
many strings strung very much like those of the pianoforte.
It is played with two little mallets in the player&rsquo;s
hands, and produces the weird arpeggios and improvised
runs characteristic of Hungarian gypsy music.
It is a very old instrument called the cembalo. About
the fifteenth century, it seems, some one devised a keyboard
attachment with quills for this instrument, tipped
the jacks with crow-quills, and called the result a clavicembalo
(a cembalo with keys). This was the origin
of the harpsichord, the name by which the clavicembalo
soon became more generally known. Harpsichords
were shaped somewhat like our grand pianofortes, but
were much smaller. A spinet was a small harpsichord,
and the virginal a still smaller one. Sometimes, indeed,
virginals were made no larger than workboxes,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
the instrument being taken out of the box and placed
on a table before the player.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this book this very general survey
of the precursors of the pianoforte seems sufficient.
The clavichord and the instruments of the harpsichord
(harpsichord, spinet, and virginal) class flourished
alongside of each other, but the best musicians gave
the preference to the clavichord because of its sweet
tone and the delicately tremulous effect that could be
produced upon it by the <i>balancement</i>. Experiments in
pianoforte making were in progress already in Bach&rsquo;s
day, but he clung to the clavichord, as did his son,
Philipp Emanuel Bach. Mozart was the first of the
great masters to realize the value of the pianoforte and
to aid materially in making it popular by using it for
his public performances. And yet even then the clavichord,
&ldquo;that lonely, melancholy, unspeakably sweet instrument,&rdquo;
was not abandoned without lingering regret
by the older musicians, and it still was to be found in
occasional use as late as the beginning of the last century.
How thoroughly modern the pianoforte is will
be appreciated when it is said that a celebrated firm
of English makers founded in 1730 did not begin to
manufacture pianofortes until 1780 and continued the
production of clavichords until 1793.</p>
<h4>Piano and Forte.</h4>
<p>Neither on the clavichord nor on the harpsichord
could the player vary the strength of the tone which he
produced, by the degree of force with which he struck
the keys. Swells and pedals worked by the knees and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
the feet were devised to overcome this difficulty, but
&ldquo;touch&rdquo; as we understand it to-day was impossible
with the instruments in which the degree of sound to
be produced was not under the control of the player&rsquo;s
fingers. The clavichord was <i>piano</i>, the harpsichord
was <i>forte</i>. Not until the invention of the hammer action,
the substitution of hammers for tangents and
quill-jacks, was an instrument possible in which
whether the tone should be <i>piano</i> or <i>forte</i> depended
upon the degree of strength with which the player
struck the keys. This instrument was the first pianoforte.
It was invented and so named in 1711 by Bartolomeo
Cristofori, of Florence, and, although nearly
two centuries have elapsed since then, the action used
by many pianoforte manufacturers of to-day is in its
essentials the same as that devised by this clever Italian.
The invention frequently is ascribed to Gottfried
Silbermann, a German (1683-1753). But the real situation
is that Cristofori was the inventor, while Silbermann
was the first successful manufacturer of the new
instruments, from a business point of view. Time and
improvements were required before they made their
way, and how slow many professional musicians were
in giving up the beloved clavichord for the pianoforte
already has been pointed out. But the latter was bound
to triumph in the end.</p>
<p>I shall not attempt to give a technical description of
the mechanism of the pianoforte. But I should like
to answer a few questions which may have suggested
themselves to players who may not have cared to
take their instruments apart and examine them, or have
not been present when their tuners have taken off the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
lid and exposed the strings and mechanism to view.
The strings of the pianoforte are of steel wire, and their
tension varies from twelve tons to nearly twenty.
Those of the deepest bass are covered with copper wire.
Eight or ten tones of the bass are produced by the
vibration of these copper-wound strings. Above these,
for about an octave and a half, the strings are in pairs,
so that, the hammer striking them, there are two unison
strings to a tone, simultaneously, and producing
approximately twice as powerful a tone as if only one
string had been set in vibration. The five remaining
octaves have three strings to a tone.</p>
<h4>All Depends on the Player.</h4>
<p>When the fingers strike the keys the hammers strike
the strings, the force of the stroke depending upon
the force exerted by the player, this being the distinguishing
merit of the pianoforte as compared with its
precursors. Under the strings are a row of dampers,
and as soon as a finger releases a key the corresponding
damper springs into place against the vibrating
strings, stops the vibrations, and the tone ceases. Thus
the tone can be dampened immediately by raising the
finger or prolonged by keeping the finger pressed down
on the key. This is the device which enables the pianist
to play <i>staccato</i> or <i>legato</i>. The damper pedal, or
loud pedal, checks the action of all the dampers and
prolongs the tones even after the fingers have released
the keys. The soft pedal brings the hammers nearer
the strings, shortens the stroke and produces a softer
tone. The simultaneous use of both pedals is a modern
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
virtuoso effect and a very charming one, for the damper
pedal prolongs the gentle tones produced by the
use of the soft pedal. I believe Paderewski was the
first of the great pianists who have visited this country,
to employ this effect systematically, and that he was
among the first composers to formally indicate the
simultaneous employment of both pedals in passages
in his compositions. There is a third pedal called the
sustaining pedal, but I do not think it has proved as
valuable an invention as was anticipated.</p>
<p>Within recent years there have been introduced mechanical
pianofortes, which I may designate as pianolas,
after the most popular instrument of their class. In
my opinion, these instruments are destined to play an
important part in the diffusion of musical knowledge,
and it is senseless to underestimate this. There are
thousands of people who have neither the time nor the
dexterity to master the technique of the pianoforte,
who nevertheless are people of genuine musical feeling,
and who are enabled through the pianola to cultivate
their taste for music. The device renders the
music accurately; whether expressively or not depends,
as with the pianoforte itself, upon the taste of the person
who manipulates it.</p>
<h4>Decorations That Do Not Beautify.</h4>
<p>The pianoforte often is spoken of as an instrument
of ugly appearance. This it emphatically is not. If the
straight side of the grand is placed against the wall
the side toward the room presents a graceful, sweeping
curve, while the upright effectively breaks the straight
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
line of the wall against which it stands. If the pianoforte
is ugly, it is due to the so-called &ldquo;ornaments&rdquo; that
are placed upon it&mdash;the knicknacks, framed pictures
and other senseless things. To my mind, there is but
one thing which it is permissible to place upon a pianoforte,
a slender vase with a single flower, preferably
a rose&mdash;the living symbol of the soul that waits to be
awakened within the instrument.</p>
<p>Sheet music or bound books of music on top of a
pianoforte are an abomination. If scattered about they
look disorderly; if neatly arranged in portfolios, even
worse, for they create the precise, orderly appearance
of paths and mounds in a cemetery. Often, indeed, the
pianoforte is a graveyard of musical hopes. Because
of that, however, it need not be made to look like one.</p>
<p>Equally objectionable is the elaborately decorated
or &ldquo;period&rdquo; pianoforte designed for rooms decorated
in the style of some historical art period. A pianoforte
has no business in a &ldquo;period&rdquo; room. If the person is
rich enough to afford &ldquo;period&rdquo; rooms, he also can afford
a music room, and the simpler this is, within the
bounds of good taste, and the less there is in it besides
the instrument itself, the better. The more proficient
the pianist the less he cares for decoration and the more
satisfied he is with the pianoforte turned out in the
ordinary course of business by the high-class manufacturer.
No&mdash;decorated pianofortes are for those who
are too rich to be musical.</p>

<h2>II</h2>
<h3>BACH&rsquo;S SERVICE TO MUSIC</h3>
</div>
<p>So important has been the rôle played by the pianoforte
in the evolution of music that it is possible
in these chapters on a pianoforte recital to give
a general survey of the art, and thus prepare the
reader to enjoy not only what he will hear at such a
recital, but enable him to approach it with a more comprehensive
knowledge than that would imply. This is
one reason why I elected to lead with the chapters on
the pianoforte instead of with those on the orchestra,
as usually is done, because the orchestra is something
&ldquo;big.&rdquo; In point of fact, however, the pianoforte, so
far as its influence is concerned, is quite as &ldquo;big,&rdquo; if
not, indeed, bigger than the orchestra; for often, in
the evolution of music (as I pointed out in the previous
chapter), this instrument, which is so sufficient
in itself, has led the orchestra. In reviewing a pianoforte
recital it therefore is quite possible to review
many phases of musical history.</p>
<p>Take as an example a composition by Bach, one of
the preludes and fugues from &ldquo;The Well-Tempered
Clavichord,&rdquo; with which a pianoforte recital is quite
apt to open. The selection illustrates a whole epoch
in music which Bach rounded off and brought alike to
its climax and its close. You will be apt to find this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span>
fugue rather complicated and, I fear, somewhat unintelligible,
and this makes it necessary for me to point
out at once that in some respects music has had a
curious development. A Wagner music-drama, a Richard
Strauss tone poem, seem elaborate and complicated
affairs compared with a Beethoven sonata or symphony.
Yet even the most advanced work of
a Wagner or Strauss is neither as complicated nor as
elaborate as a fugue by that past master of his art,
Johann Sebastian Bach, who, although he was born
in 1685 and did not live beyond the middle of the following
century, was so far ahead of his age that not
even to this day has he fully come into his own. The
result is that the early classicists, Haydn and Mozart,
who belong in point of time to a later epoch, may more
readily be reckoned as &ldquo;old-fashioned&rdquo; than Father
Bach. When at a recital you listen to a fugue by Bach
and find it hard and labored&mdash;many people regard it
simply as a difficult species of finger exercises&mdash;you
think that is because it is so very ancient, something
in the same class with Greek or Sanscrit. In point of
fact it is because in some respects it is so very modern.</p>
<p>Were it not for the importance of preserving an
orderly historical sequence in a book of this kind, and
that Bach usually is found at the beginning of a recital
program, it would be almost more practical, and certainly
far easier, for the author to leave Bach until
later. When you write of Mozart, or of Beethoven and
the moderns, you can depend upon more or less familiarity
with their works on the part of your readers,
whereas, comparatively few laymen know much about
Bach. They associate the name with all that is formal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
and labored. Yet among my acquaintances is a young
woman who was brought up in a very musical family,
and who, having as a child heard her mother play the
preludes and fugues of the &ldquo;Well-Tempered Clavichord,&rdquo;
finds Bach as simple as the alphabet. But hers
is a most exceptional case. The appreciation of Bach,
as a rule, comes only with advanced age. My music
teacher used to say to me: &ldquo;You rave over Schubert
and Wagner now, but when you get to be as old as
I am you will go back to Father Bach.&rdquo; While I cannot
say that his prophecy has come true, while I still
am ultra-modern in my musical predilections, my musical
gods being Schubert, Chopin, Schumann, Liszt,
Brahms, Richard Strauss and, above all, Wagner, I
should consider myself unfit to write this book if I
failed to realize the debt modern music owes to Bach,
and that the more modern the music the greater the
debt.</p>
<h4>Bach in Modern Music.</h4>
<p>One of the most remarkable phenomena in the history
of the art&mdash;and a generalization like this is as
much in place in discussing pianoforte music as elsewhere,
because the instrument has had so much to do
with the evolution of music&mdash;is the gap between Bach
and modern music. While the following must not be
taken too literally, it is true in general that Bach had
little or no influence on the age that immediately came
after him, the classical age of music, that age which we
sum up in the names of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven,
the age of the sonata and the symphony. The three masters
mentioned probably would have developed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
composed much as they did had Bach never lived. But
when a more modern composer, a romanticist like
Wagner, wanted to enrich the means of musical
expression handed down to him from the classical
period, he reached back to Bach and combined Bach&rsquo;s
teeming counterpoint with the harmonic system which
had been inherited from Beethoven. To understand
just what this means, to appreciate the influence Bach
has had upon modern music and why he had little or
none on the classical composers, it is necessary for the
reader to have at least a reasonably clear conception of
what that counterpoint is and wherein it differs from
harmony; for with Bach counterpoint reached its climax,
and all the possibilities of the style having been
exhausted by him, music of necessity took a turn in
another direction under the classicists and developed
harmonically instead of contrapuntally; so that it
can be said that modern music derives its counterpoint
from Bach, its harmony from Beethoven,
and its combination of the two systems from
Wagner.</p>
<p>There is another reason why the meaning of counterpoint
should be explained and the difference between
counterpoint and harmony be made clear to the reader
now. Nearly all the early music, the music that preceded
Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, and that sometimes
is to be found on recital programs, is contrapuntal&mdash;written
in counterpoint. As I have said before, it
would be much easier to start with the sonata form,
with harmony instead of counterpoint, for of the two
harmony is the simpler. But we must &ldquo;face the music&rdquo;&mdash;the
music of the old contrapuntal composers&mdash;and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
the best way to do this is to explain what harmony and
counterpoint are and wherein they differ.</p>
<h4>Harmony and Counterpoint.</h4>
<p>A melody or theme is a rational progression of single
tones. Here is the melody or theme with which Beethoven
begins the familiar &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata&rdquo;:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_1' id='linki_1'></a>
</div>
<a href='images/big_illus-052a.png'>
<img src='images/illus-052a.png' alt='' title='' width='500' height='52' /><br />
</a>
<p class='caption'>
<i>Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata&rdquo;</i><br />[<a href="music/052a.mid">Listen</a>]<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>It is a melody, but it does not constitute harmony, for
harmony is the rational combination of several tones,
as distinguished from the rational progression of single
tones which constitute melody. But when Beethoven
adds an accompaniment to his theme and it becomes:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_2' id='linki_2'></a>
</div>
<a href='images/big_illus-052b.png'>
<img src='images/illus-052b.png' alt='' title='' width='500' height='349' /><br />
</a>
<p class='caption'>
<i>Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata&rdquo;</i><br />[<a href="music/052b.mid">Listen</a>]<br />
</p>
</div>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></div>
<p>the passage also becomes harmony, since it is an example
of the rational combination of several tones. As
has often been pointed out in books on music, and probably
often will have to be pointed out again, because
as a mistake it is to be classed with the hardy perennials,
melody is not harmony, but only a part of it.
When, however, a composer conceives a theme or melody
he usually does so with the purpose of combining
it with an accompaniment that shall support it and
throw it into bold and striking relief. Composers of
the contrapuntal school, on the other hand, conceived
a theme, not for the purpose of supporting it with an
accompaniment, but in order to combine it with another
or with several other equally important themes. That,
in a general way, is the difference between harmony
and counterpoint.</p>
<p>In harmony, then, or, more strictly speaking, in
music composed according to the harmonic system, of
which the &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata&rdquo; is a good example, the
theme, the melody, stands out from the accompaniment,
which is subordinate. Counterpoint, on the other hand,
rests on the combination of several themes, each of
equal importance. This is the reason why, when there is
a fugue or other complicated contrapuntal work on the
program of a pianoforte recital, the average listener
is apt to find it dry and uninteresting. His ear readily
can distinguish the themes of a sonata, which usually
are heard one at a time and stand out clearly from the
accompaniment, but it has not been trained to unravel
the themes of the fugue as they travel along together.
Counterpoint, the term being derived from the Latin
<i>contra punctum</i>, which means point against point or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
note against note, when complicated, as in a fugue, is
about the most elaborate kind of music there is, and
a person who is unable to grasp a fugue may console
himself with the thought that, excepting for the elect,
it is a pretty stiff dose to swallow at the very beginning
of a recital.</p>
<p>There are, however, simpler pieces of counterpoint
than a fugue. Sometimes, as in the charming little &ldquo;Gavotte&rdquo;
by Padre Martini, which now and then figures
among the lighter numbers on the programs of historical
recitals, the contrapuntist combines a theme with
itself, or, rather, &ldquo;imitates&rdquo; it, which is a simple form
of the canon. Another form of canon is the round of
which &ldquo;Three Blind Mice&rdquo; is a familiar example. How
many people, when singing this, have realized that
they were being initiated into that mysterious thing
known as counterpoint? A comparatively simple form
of counterpoint is well illustrated by a dapper little
piece in Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Two-Part Inventions,&rdquo; in which the
spirited theme given out by the right hand answers itself
a bar later in the left, an &ldquo;imitation&rdquo; which crops out
again and again in the piece and gives it somewhat the
character of a canon.</p>

<p>For any one who wishes to become acquainted with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
Bach there is nothing better than these &ldquo;Two-Part Inventions,&rdquo;
especially the fascinating little piece from
which I have just quoted, compact, buoyant and gay,
even &ldquo;pert,&rdquo; as I once heard a young girl characterize
it; a perfect example of old Father Bach in moments
of relaxation when he has laid aside his periwig and
is amusing himself at his clavichord.</p>
<h4>What a Fugue Is.</h4>
<p>Bach&rsquo;s fugues, and especially his &ldquo;Well-Tempered
Clavichord,&rdquo; forty-eight preludes and fugues in all the
keys, form the climax of contrapuntal music. Goethe
once said that &ldquo;the history of the world is a mighty
fugue in which the voice of nation after nation becomes
audible.&rdquo; This is a freely poetic definition of
that highly complicated musical form, the fugue. Let
me attempt to illustrate it in a different way.</p>
<p>Imagine that a composer who is an adept in
counterpoint places four pianists at different pianofortes,
and that he gives a different theme to each of
them, or a theme to one and modified versions of it to
the others. He starts the first pianist, after a few bars
nods to the second to join in with his theme, and so
on successively with the other two. It might be supposed
that when the second player joins in, the two
themes sounding together would make discord, which
would be aggravated by the addition of the third and
fourth. But, instead, they have been so conceived by
the contrapuntist that they sound well together as they
chase and answer each other, or run counter to and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
parallel and enter into many different combinations,
sometimes flowing along smoothly, at other times surging
and striving, yet always, in the case of a truly
great fugue, borne along by a momentum as inexorable
as the march of Fate. Of course, it must not be supposed,
because I have called four pianists into action
in order to emphasize how distinct are these themes,
which yet, when united, are found to blend together,
that several players are required for the performance
of a complicated piece of counterpoint like a fugue.
What is demanded of the player is entire independence
of the fingers, so that he can clearly differentiate between
the themes and enable the hearer to distinguish
them apart, even in their most complicated combinations.
An edition of Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Well-Tempered Clavichord&rdquo;
by Bernardus Boekelman prints the themes in
different colors, so that they are easy to trace through
all their interweaving, and is interesting to study from.</p>
<h4>The Fugue and the Virtuoso.</h4>
<p>In his book, &ldquo;Beethoven and His Forerunners,&rdquo; Daniel
Gregory Mason devotes a paragraph toward dispelling
the mystery regarding the fugue that prevails
with the public, and points out that &ldquo;the actual formal
rules, despite the awe they have immemorially aroused
in the popular mind, are few and simple. After the
first announcement of the subject by a single voice, it
is answered by a second voice, at an interval of a fifth
above; then again stated by a third voice, and answered
by a fourth. This process goes on until each voice has
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
had a chance to enunciate the motif, after which the
conversation goes on more freely; the subject is announced
in divers keys, by divers voices; episodes, in a
congruous style, vary the monotony; at last the subject
is emphatically asserted by the various voices in
quick succession (<i>stretto</i>), and with some little display
or grandiloquence the piece comes to an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Further along in the same book Mr. Mason has a
page of apostrophe to the Bach fugues. When he characterizes
them as &ldquo;the first great independent monuments
of pure music,&rdquo; and refers to their &ldquo;consummate
beauty of structure,&rdquo; he pays them an eminently just
tribute. But when he speaks of the &ldquo;profundity,
poignancy and variety of feeling they express,&rdquo; I am
inclined to quote his own qualifying sentence from the
next page of his book: &ldquo;It is true, nevertheless, not
only that the fugue form makes the severest demands
on the attention and intelligence of the listener, but
also that, because of the ecclesiastical origin and polyphonic
style, it is incapable of the kind of highly personal,
secular expression that it was in the spirit of
the seventeenth century to demand.&rdquo; The same is even
more true of the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. The progress of music toward individual
freedom of expression on the part of the composer, and
equally so on the part of the interpreter, has been
steady, and when, through the very perfection which
Bach imparted to counterpoint, it ceased to attract
composers as a means of expression because he had
accomplished so much there was nothing more left
for them to do along the same lines, the progress I
have indicated received a great lift and stimulus.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span></div>
<h4>What Counterpoint Lacks.</h4>
<p>The lack of highly personal expression in contrapuntal
compositions explains why most concert-goers
find them less attractive than modern music. The
&ldquo;D Minor Toccata and Fugue&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Chromatic Fantasie
and Fugue&rdquo; by Bach, even in the arrangements of
Tausig and Liszt, on the program of a pianoforte recital,
are tolerated because of the modern pieces that
come later. Nine out of ten persons in the house would
rather omit them. Why deny so obvious a fact, especially
when it is easy enough to explain? To follow
a contrapuntal composition intelligently requires a
highly trained ear. Moreover, in such a work as a
Bach fugue the individuality of the player is of less
importance than in modern music. Yet a virtuoso&rsquo;s
individuality is the very thing that distinguishes him
from other virtuosos and attracts the public to his concerts,
while those of other players may be poorly attended.
I firmly believe in personality of the virtuoso
or singer or orchestral conductor, for in it lies the secret
of individual interpretation, the reason why the performance
of one person is fascinating or thrilling and
that of another not. Modern music affords the player
full scope to interpret it according to his own mood
and fancy, to color it with his own personality, whereas
contrapuntal music exists largely for itself alone. It
is music for music&rsquo;s sake, not for the sake of interpreting
some mood, some feeling, or of painting in tone
colors something quite outside of music. The player
of counterpoint is restricted in his power of expression
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
by the very formulas of the science or art of the contrapuntist.
We may marvel that Bach was able to
move so freely within its restricted forms. But I think
it true that it is far more interesting for a person
even of only moderate proficiency as a player to work
out, however awkwardly, a Bach fugue for himself
on the pianoforte than to hear it played by some one
else, however great; for, cheap and easy as it is to protest
in high-sounding phrases about the duty of the
interpreter to subordinate himself to the composer, and
against what I am about to say, I nevertheless make
bold to affirm that it is the province of the virtuoso to
express himself, his own personality, his moods, his
temperament, his subjective or even his subconscious
self, through music; and in music that is purely contrapuntal
there is a barrier to this individual power of
expression.</p>
<h4>The Mission of the Player.</h4>
<p>We often hear it said of the greatest contemporary
pianist that he is a great Chopin player, but not a great
Bach player. He could not be, and at the same time
be the greatest living virtuoso. It is the worshiper
of tradition, the reserved, continent, scholarly player,
the player who converts a Chopin nocturne into an
icicle and a Schubert impromptu into a snowball, who
revels in counterpoint&mdash;the player who always is
slavishly subordinating himself to what he is pleased
to call the &ldquo;composer&rsquo;s intentions&rdquo; and forgets that the
truly great virtuoso creates when he interprets. Some
times the virtuoso may go too far and depart too much
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
from the character of the piece he is playing, subjecting
it more than is permissible to his temporary mood;
but it is better for art to err on the side of originality,
provided it is not bizarre or freakish, than on the side
of subserviency to tradition.</p>
<p>While I have no desire, in writing as above, to exalt
unduly the virtuoso, the interpreter of music, at the expense
of the composer, I must insist that the great
player also is creative, in the sense that every time he
plays a work he creates it over again from his own
point of view, and thus has at least a share in its parentage.
Indeed, it seems more difficult to attain exalted
rank as a virtuoso than to gain immortality as
a composer. The world has produced two epoch-making
virtuosos&mdash;Paganini on the violin, Liszt on the
piano. Within about the same period covered by the
careers of these two there have been half a dozen or
even more composers, each of whom marks an epoch
in some phase of the art. &ldquo;The interpretive artist,&rdquo;
says Henry G. Hanchett in his &ldquo;Art of the Musician,&rdquo;
&ldquo;deserves a place no whit beneath that of the composer.
No two composers have influenced musical progress
in America more strongly than have Anton Rubinstein
by his <em>playing</em>, and Theodore Thomas, who was not a
composer.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Music as a Science.</h4>
<p>But, to return to Bach and the other contrapuntists,
music owes them an immense debt on the technical
side. And right here, so universal are the deductions
that can be drawn from the program of a pianoforte
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
recital, it should be pointed out that music differs from
other arts in having for its basis a profound and complicated
science, a science that concerns itself with the
relations of the notes of the musical scale to each other.
Upon this science are based alike the &ldquo;coon song&rdquo; and
the Wagner music-drama. What is true of &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; is
true also of &ldquo;Bedelia.&rdquo; Each makes its draft upon the
science of music; the music-drama, of course, in a far
greater degree than the song. This science has its textbooks
with their theorems and problems, like any
other science, and theoretical musicians have produced
learned and useful works on the subject which the
great mass of laymen, many virtuosos, and indeed the
average professional musician, may never have heard
of, let alone have read. For a person not intuitively
predisposed toward the subject would find the science
of music as difficult to master as integral calculus; nor,
in order to appreciate music, or even to interpret it,
is it necessary to be versed in this science. A virtuoso
can play a chord of the ninth, the listener can be thrilled
by the virtuoso&rsquo;s playing of the chord of the ninth,
without either of them knowing that there is such a
thing as the chord of the ninth.</p>
<h4>Science versus Feeling.</h4>
<p>In fact, the person who is so well versed in the science
of music that he can mentally analyze a composition
while listening to it is apt to be so absorbed in the
mere process of technical analysis that he misses its
esthetic, its emotional significance. Thus a person may
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
be very musical without being musical at all. He may
have profound knowledge of music as a science and
remain untouched by music as an art, just as a physicist
may be an authority on the laws of light and color,
yet stand unmoved before a great painting. With
some people music is all science, with others all art,
and I think the latter have the better of it. A musical
genius is equipped both ways. The great composer
employs the science of music as an aid in giving expression
to his creative impulse. He makes science
of service to the cause of art. Otherwise, while he
might produce something that was absolutely correct,
it would make no artistic appeal whatsoever. Thousands
of symphonies have been composed, performed
and forgotten. They were &ldquo;well made,&rdquo; constructed
with scientific accuracy from beginning to end, but
had no value as art; and music is a profound science
applied to the production of a great art.</p>
<p>The composer, then, masters the science of music
and bends it to his genius. If he is a great genius, he
soon will discover that certain rules which his predecessors
regarded as hard and fast, as inviolable, can
be violated with impunity. He will discover new tone
combinations, and thus enrich the science and make it
serve the purposes of the art with greater efficiency
than before he came upon the scene. And always the
composers who have grown gray under the old system,
the system upon which the new genius is grafting his
new ideas, and the theorists and critics, who are slaves
of tradition, will throw up their hands in horror and cry
out that he is despoiling the art and robbing it of all that
is sacred and beautiful, whereas he is adding to its scope
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
and potency. Did not even so broad-minded a composer
as Schumann say, &ldquo;The trouble with Wagner
is that he is not a musician&rdquo;? So far was Wagner
ahead of his time! While the great composer nearly
always begins where his predecessors left off, he is sure
to outstrip them later on. Even so rugged a genius
as Beethoven is somewhat under Mozart&rsquo;s influence in
his first works, and Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rienzi&rdquo; is distinctly
Meyerbeerian. But genius soon learns to soar with its
own wings and to look down with indifference upon the
little men who are discharging their shafts of envy,
malice and ignorance.</p>
<h4>That &ldquo;Ear for Music.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>And while I am on the subject of the scientific musician
<i>versus</i> the music lover, the pedant <i>versus</i> the innovator,
I might as well refer to those people who have
in a remarkable degree what is popularly known as &ldquo;an
ear for music,&rdquo; and who are able to remember and to
play &ldquo;by ear&rdquo; anything they hear played or sung, even
if it is for the first time. This ear for music, again,
is something quite different from scientific knowledge
of music or from the emotional sensitiveness which
makes the music-lover. It is a purely physical endowment,
and may&mdash;in fact, usually does&mdash;exist without
a corresponding degree of real feeling for music. It
is, of course, a highly valuable adjunct to a genuine
musical genius like a Mozart or a Schubert and to a
genuine virtuoso. It is related of Von Bülow that his
ear for music and his memory were so prodigious that
once, while traveling in the cars, he read over the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span>
printed pages of a new composition, and on arriving at
his destination, played it, from memory, at his concert.
William Mason, who studied with Liszt, witnessed his
master perform a similar feat. The average untrained
person with a musical ear, however, instead of being
a genius, is apt to become a nuisance, playing all kinds
of cheap music in and out of season&mdash;a sort of peripatetic
pianola, without the advantage of being under
control. Such persons, moreover, usually are born
without a soft pedal.</p>
<h4>Bach and the Weather Bureau.</h4>
<p>This digression, which I have made in order to discuss
the difference between music as a science and music
as an art, a distinction which, I have pointed out, often
is so marked that a person may be thoroughly equipped
on the scientific side of music without being sensitive
to its beauty as an art, seemed to me necessary at this
stage. I am reminded by it of the distinction which
Edmund Clarence Stedman, in his &ldquo;Nature and Elements
of Poetry,&rdquo; so wittily draws between the indications
of a storm as described by a poet and by the
official prognostications of the Weather Bureau. Mr.
Stedman quotes two stanzas:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;When descends on the Atlantic the gigantic<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Storm-wind of the Equinox,<br />
Landward in his wrath he scourges the toiling surges,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Laden with seaweed from the rocks.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>And this stanza by a later balladist:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span></div>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;The East Wind gathered, all unknown,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>A thick sea-cloud his course before;<br />
He left by night the frozen zone,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>And smote the cliffs of Labrador;<br />
He lashed the coasts on either hand,<br />
And betwixt the Cape and Newfoundland,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>Into the bay his armies pour.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>All this impersonation and fancy is translated by the
Weather Bureau into something like the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;An area of extreme low pressure is rapidly moving
up the Atlantic Coast, with wind and rain. Storm-center
now off Charleston, S. C. Wind N. E.; velocity,
54. Barometer, 29.6. The disturbance will reach New
York on Wednesday, and proceed eastward to the
Banks and Bay of St. Lawrence. Danger signals ordered
for all North Atlantic ports.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Far be it from me to imply that contrapuntal music
in general or Bach in particular represents the Weather
Bureau. None the less is it true that Bach appeals
more strongly to the scientific musician than to the
music-lover who seeks in music a secondary meaning&mdash;love,
passion, grief; the mood awakened by the contemplation
of a forest landscape with its murmuring
foliage, a boundless prairie, or the unquiet sea.</p>
<p>The technical indebtedness of modern music to Bach
is so immense, and the artistic probity of the man himself
was so wonderful, for he worked calmly on, in
spite of what was worse than opposition&mdash;neglect&mdash;that
I think the tendency on the part of Bach enthusiasts,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
while not overrating the importance of the influence
he has had during the past fifty years or more, is
to underrate others as compared with him. When
critics declare that one virtuoso or another is not a
great Bach player, are they not ignoring what is a
simple fact&mdash;that no player can make the same appeal
through Bach that it is possible for him to make
through modern music, and that, as a rule, when
a virtuoso, however good a musician he may be,
places Bach on his program, he does so not from predilection,
but as a tribute to one of the greatest names
in musical history? It seems to me that the extreme
Bach enthusiasts can be divided into two classes&mdash;musicians
who are able to appreciate what he did for
music on its technical side, and people who want to
create the impression that they know more than they
really do.</p>
<h4>The Bacon, Not the Shakespeare, of Music.</h4>
<p>Bach&rsquo;s greatest importance to music lies in his having
treated it in the abstract and for itself alone, so
that when he penned a work he did this not to bring
home to the listener the significance of a certain mood
or situation, but from pure delight in following out a
musical problem to its most extreme development. Algebra
makes mighty interesting study, but furnishes
rather a poor subject for dramatic reading. This simile
must, of course, be taken with a grain of salt, and
merely as illustrating in a general way my contention
that Bach&rsquo;s great service to music was technical and
intellectual. He was the Bacon, not the Shakespeare,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
of music, and the contrapuntal structure that he reared
is to the art what the Baconian theorem is to logic.
We can imagine the roamer in the field of higher mathematics
suddenly becoming excited as he sees the end
of the path leading to the solution of some complicated
problem in full view. Thus there may be moments
when even the cube root becomes emotional, the logarithmic
theory a dissipation, and differential calculus an
orgy. So, too, Bach put an enthusiasm into his work
that often threatens to sweep the student off his intellectuals
and make him regard a fugue as a scientifically
constructed fairyland. Moreover, there are Bach pieces
in which the counterpoint supports the purest kind of
melody, like the air for the G string which Thomas
arranged for his orchestra with all the strings, save the
double basses, in unison, and played with an effect that
never failed to secure a repeat and sometimes a double
encore.</p>
<h4>What Wagner Learned from Bach.</h4>
<p>If we bear in mind that counterpoint is the artistic
combination of several themes, each of equal or nearly
equal importance, and that Bach was the greatest master
of the contrapuntal school and forms its climax,
we can, with a little thought, appreciate what his service
has been to modern music. When Wagner devised
his system of leading motives it was not for the
purpose of employing them singly, like labels tacked
onto each character, thing or symbol in the drama, but
of combining them, welding them together, when occasion
arose, in order to give musical significance and
expression to each and every dramatic situation as the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
story unfolded itself. A shining example of this is
found in that wonderful last scene of &ldquo;Die Walküre,&rdquo;
the so-called Magic Fire Scene. <i>Wotan</i> has said farewell
to <i>Brünnhilde</i>; has thrown her into a profound
slumber upon the rock; has surrounded her with a circle
of magic flame which none but a hero may penetrate
to awaken and win her. How is this scene treated in
the score? In the higher register of the orchestra
crackles and sparkles the Magic Fire Motive, the Slumber
Motive gently rising and falling with the flames;
while the superb Siegfried Motive (signifying that the
yet unborn <i>Siegfried</i> is the hero destined to break
through the fiery circle) resounds in the brass, and
there also is a suggestion of the tender strains with
which <i>Wotan</i> bade <i>Brünnhilde</i> farewell. The welding
together of these four motives into one glorious whole
of the highest dramatic significance is Wagnerian counterpoint&mdash;science
employed in the service of art and
with thrilling effect. Another passage from Wagner,
the closing episode in the &ldquo;Meistersinger&rdquo; Vorspiel,
often is quoted to show Wagner&rsquo;s skill in the use of
counterpoint, although he employs it so spontaneously
that few people stop to consider how scientific his musical
structure is. W. J. Henderson, in his capital book,
&ldquo;The Orchestra and Orchestral Music,&rdquo; relates that on
one occasion a professional musician was engaged in
a discussion of Wagner in the corridor of the Metropolitan
Opera House, while inside the orchestra was
playing this &ldquo;Meistersinger&rdquo; Vorspiel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity,&rdquo; said this wise man, in a condescending
manner, &ldquo;but Wagner knows absolutely nothing about
counterpoint.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span></div>
<p>At that very instant the orchestra was singing five
different melodies at once; and, as Anton Seidl was the
conductor, they were all audible.</p>
<p>Wagner scores, in fact, teem with counterpoint,
but counterpoint that palpitates, that thrills with emotion.
Note that Mr. Henderson speaks of melodies.
Wagner&rsquo;s leading motives are melodies, sometimes very
brief, but always expressive, and not, like the themes
of the old contrapuntists, conceived mainly for the sake
of being combined scientifically with other themes
equally adaptable to that purpose. Counterpoint may
be, and usually is, something very dry and formal. But
from the crucible of the master magician, Richard
Wagner, it flows a glowing, throbbing, pulsating
stream of most precious metal.</p>
<h4>The Language of an Epoch.</h4>
<p>In the difference between the counterpoint of Bach
and the counterpoint of Wagner lies the difference between
two epochs separated by a long period of time.
With Bach counterpoint was everything; with Wagner
merely an incident. It will help us to a better
understanding of music if we bear in mind
that the two great composers of each epoch
spoke in the music of that epoch. Thus Bach
spoke in the language of counterpoint. His themes,
however greatly they may vary among themselves,
all bear the stamp of motives devised for the
purpose of entering into formal combinations and of
being developed according to the stringent rules of
counterpoint. Beethoven&rsquo;s are more individual, more
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
expressive of moods and emotions. Yet about them,
too, there is something formal. They, too, are devised
to be treated according to certain rules&mdash;to be molded
into sonatas. But with Wagner we feel that music has
thrown off the shackles of arbitrary form, of dry rule
and rote. His motives suggest absolute freedom of
expression and development, through previously undreamed-of
wealth of harmony and contrapuntal combinations
which are mere incidents, not the chief purpose
of their being. Each represents some person, impulse or
symbol in a drama; represents them with such eloquence
and power that, once we know for what they stand, we
need but hear them again or recall them to memory
to have the corresponding episode in the music-drama
in which they occur brought vividly before our eyes.
Bach&rsquo;s language was the language of the fugue; Beethoven&rsquo;s
the language of the sonata. Fugue and sonata
are musical forms. Wagner spoke the language of no
form. His language is that of the free, plastic, unfettered
leading motive&mdash;the language of liberated music,
of which he himself was the liberator!</p>
<p>Whether Wagner would have devised his system of
leading motives without the wonderful structure of
counterpoint left by Bach; whether Bach&rsquo;s counterpoint,
his combination of themes, suggested the system
of leading motives to the greatest master of them all,
we probably never shall know. The system, in its completeness,
doubtless is Wagner&rsquo;s own; but when he came
to put it into practical effect he found the rich heritage
left by Bach ready to hand. One of Wagner&rsquo;s instructors
in musical theory, and the one from whose teaching
he himself declares he learned most, was Theodor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
Weinlig, one of Bach&rsquo;s successors as Cantor of the
Thomasschule at Leipsic. Wagner quotes him as having
said: &ldquo;You may never find it necessary to compose
a fugue, but the ability to do it often may stand
you in good stead.&rdquo; And the Cantor set him exercises
in all varieties of counterpoint. There thus is presented
the phenomenon of a composer who for nearly
a century after his death had little or no influence on
the course of music, suddenly becoming a potent force
in its most modern development.</p>
<h4>Bach in the Recital Hall.</h4>
<p>Bach is so supreme in his own line that contrapuntal
music, so far as the pianoforte is concerned, may be dismissed
with him. Händel, too, it is true, was a master
of the contrapuntal school, but he belongs to the chapter
on oratorio. Bach&rsquo;s pianoforte works in smaller
form are the &ldquo;Two-Part Inventions&rdquo; already mentioned;
the &ldquo;Three-Part Inventions,&rdquo; which go a step
farther in contrapuntal treatment, and the &ldquo;Partitas,&rdquo;
the six &ldquo;French Suites&rdquo; and the six &ldquo;English Suites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These partitas and suites are the most graceful and
charming efflorescence of the contrapuntal school, and
much could be accomplished toward making Bach a
popular composer if they figured more frequently on
recital programs. They are made up of the dance forms
of the day&mdash;allemandes, courants, bourrées, sarabandes,
minuets, gavottes, gigues, with airs thrown in for good
measure; the partitas and English suites furnished with
more elaborate introductions, while the French suites
begin with allemandes. Cheerful and even frisky as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
some of the dance pieces in these compositions are, it
must not be supposed that they were intended to be
danced to when contrapuntally treated&mdash;no more than
Chopin intended that people should glide through a
ballroom to the music of his waltzes.</p>
<p>Besides &ldquo;sonatas&rdquo; for pianoforte with one or more
other instruments, among them the six &ldquo;Sonatas for
Pianoforte and Violin&rdquo; (the term sonata as employed
here must not be confused with the classical sonata
form as developed by Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven),
Bach composed concertos for from one to four pianofortes.
Of these latter the one best known in this country
is the so-called &ldquo;Triple Concerto,&rdquo; for three pianofortes
with accompaniment of string quartet, which
can at will be increased to a string orchestra. In 1873,
during Rubinstein&rsquo;s tour, I heard it played in New
York, under Theodore Thomas&rsquo;s direction, by Rubinstein,
William Mason and Sebastian Bach Mills, and
three years later by Mme. Annette Essipoff, Mr.
Mason and Mr. Boscovitz. Mason, when he was studying
under Liszt in Weimar in 1854, had performed it
with two fellow-pupils, and Liszt had been very particular
in regard to the manner in which they played
the many embellishments (<i>agréments</i>) which were
used in Bach&rsquo;s time. Later, Mason found that whenever
three pianists came together for the purpose of
playing this concerto they were certain to disagree regarding
&ldquo;the agreements,&rdquo; and usually wasted much
time in discussing them, especially the mordent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></div>
<h4>Rubinstein and the &ldquo;Triple Concerto.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Accordingly, when Mason played the &ldquo;Triple Concerto&rdquo;
with Rubinstein and Mills, he came to the rehearsal
armed with a book by Friedrich Wilhelm Marburg,
published in Berlin in 1765, and giving written
examples of all the <i>agréments</i>. &ldquo;I told Rubinstein
about my ancient authority,&rdquo; says Mr. Mason in his
entertaining &ldquo;Memories of a Musical Life,&rdquo; &ldquo;adding
that we should be spared the tediousness of a discussion
as to the manner of playing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Let me see the old book,&rsquo; said Rubinstein. Running
over the leaves he came to the illustrations of the
mordent. The moment his eyes fell upon them he exclaimed:
&lsquo;All wrong; here is the way I play it!&rsquo;&rdquo; And
that ended the usefulness of &ldquo;the old book&rdquo; for that
particular occasion, the other two pianists adopting,
without comment, Rubinstein&rsquo;s method, which Mr.
Mason intimates was incorrect.</p>
<p>When, at the rehearsal with Essipoff, the mordent
came up for discussion she exclaimed: &ldquo;&lsquo;I cannot play
these things; show me how they are done.&rsquo; After repeated
trials, however,&rdquo; records Mr. Mason, &ldquo;she failed
to get the knack of playing them, as indeed so many
pianists do; so at the rehearsal she omitted them and
left their performance to Boscovitz and me.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>&ldquo;The Well-Tempered Clavichord.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Bach&rsquo;s monumental work for pianoforte, however, is
&ldquo;The Well-Tempered Clavichord,&rdquo; consisting of forty-eight
preludes and fugues in all keys. I find much
prevalent ignorance among amateurs regarding the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
meaning of &ldquo;well-tempered&rdquo; as used in this title. I
have heard people explain it by saying that when a
pianist had mastered the book he was &ldquo;tempered&rdquo; like
steel and ready for any difficulties that other music
might present! I even have heard a rotund and affable
person say that &ldquo;The Well-Tempered Clavichord&rdquo; was
so entitled because when you listened to its preludes
and fugues it smoothed out your temper and made you
feel good-natured! In point of fact, the word is difficult
to explain in untechnical language. It relates, however,
to Bach&rsquo;s method of tuning his clavichord&mdash;another
boon which he conferred upon music. In general,
the system may be explained by the statement that
certain tone intervals, which theoretically are pure,
practically result in harmonic discrepancies, which
Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;tempered&rdquo; system corrected. In other words,
slight and practically imperceptible inaccuracies are introduced
in the tuning in order to counterbalance the
greater faults which result when tuning is absolutely
correct from a theoretical point of view; just as,
in navigating the high northern waters, you are
obliged to make allowance for variations of the compass.
The system was not actually the invention of
Bach, but he did so much to promote its adoption that
it is associated with his name. Before it was adopted it
was impossible to employ all the major and minor keys
on clavichords and harpsichords, and on the pianofortes,
just beginning to come into use. It became
possible under the tempered system of tuning, and was
illustrated by Bach in &ldquo;The Well-Tempered Clavichord,&rdquo;
each major and minor key being represented by
a prelude and fugue.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span></div>
<p>Besides the system of tuning in &ldquo;equal temperament,&rdquo;
Bach modernized the technique of fingering
by introducing the freer and more frequent employment
of the hitherto neglected thumb and little finger.
The services of this great man to music, therefore, were
threefold. He left us his teeming counterpoint, upon
which modern music draws so freely; he promoted the
system of tuning in equal temperament; and he laid
the foundation of modern pianoforte technique, and
so of modern virtuosity.</p>
<h4>A King&rsquo;s Tribute to Bach.</h4>
<p>Besides being a great composer, Bach&rsquo;s traits as a
man were most admirable. He was uncompromising
in his convictions, sturdy, honest and upright. His
fixedness of purpose is shown by an anecdote of his
boyhood. In his tenth year he lost his parents and
went to live with an elder brother, who was so jealous
of his superior talents that he refused him the loan of
a manuscript volume of music by composers of the day.
Obtaining possession of it without his brother&rsquo;s knowledge,
Bach secretly copied it at night by moonlight, the
task covering something like six months. His reward
was to have it taken away by his brother, who accidentally
discovered him playing from it. Fortunately,
this brother died soon afterward, and Bach recovered
his treasure.</p>
<p>While it is true that Bach remained unappreciated
by the great mass of his contemporaries, there were
exceptions, a notable one being the music-loving king,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
Frederick the Great of Prussia, whose service the composer&rsquo;s
second son, Philipp Emanuel Bach, entered in
1746. At the king&rsquo;s earnest urging, Philipp Emanuel
induced his father to visit Potsdam the following year.
The king, who had arranged a concert at the palace,
was about to begin playing on the flute, when an officer
entered and handed him a list of the strangers who had
arrived at Potsdam. Glancing over it, Frederick discovered
Bach&rsquo;s name. &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
&ldquo;old Bach is here!&rdquo; And nothing would do save that
the master must be brought immediately into the royal
presence, before he even had time to doff his traveling
clothes.</p>
<p>The king had purchased several of the pianofortes
recently constructed by Gottfried Silbermann and had
them distributed throughout the palace. Bach and the
assemblage went from room to room, the composer
playing and improvising on the different instruments.
Finally he asked the king to set him a fugue theme,
and on this he extemporized in such masterly fashion
that all who heard him, the king included, broke out
into rounds of applause. On his return to Leipsic,
Bach dedicated to Frederick the Great a work which
he entitled &ldquo;The Musical Sacrifice&rdquo; (or offering),
which he based upon the fugue theme the king had
given him.</p>
<p>No other instance of musical heredity is comparable
with that afforded by the Bach family. Dr. Theodore
Baker, in his &ldquo;Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,&rdquo;
gives a list of no less than twenty Bachs, all of the
same line, whom he deems worthy of mention, and
who covered a period ranging from 1604 to 1845,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
when the great Bach&rsquo;s grandson and last male descendant,
Wilhelm Friedrich Ernst Bach, died in Berlin.
Thus for two hundred and forty-one years the Bach
family was professionally active in music.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<h3>FROM FUGUE TO SONATA</h3>
</div>
<p>If a pianoforte recital which begins with a Bach
fugue continues with a Beethoven sonata, it does
not require a very discriminating ear to note the
difference between the two. The Beethoven sonata is in
a style so entirely distinct from that of the fugue, and
sounds so wholly unlike it, that it seems as if Bach had
exerted no influence whatsoever upon the greatest master
of the period that followed his death. Although
Haydn and Mozart were nearer Bach in point of time
than Beethoven was, a sonata by either of them, if it
chanced to be on the program, would show the same
difference in style, the same radical departure from the
works of the master of counterpoint, as the Beethoven
sonata.</p>
<p>The question naturally suggests itself, did Bach&rsquo;s
influence cease with his death? And the fact that this
question calls for an answer and that this answer leads
to a general consideration of the interim between Bach
and Beethoven, again shows how broad in its scope
as an instrument is the pianoforte and how comprehensive
in its application to music as a whole is the
music of that instrument. Two works on a recital
program furnish a legitimate basis for a discussion
of two important periods in the development of music!
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span>
Who would have thought there was so much to a
pianoforte recital?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It would have been an eminently pardonable mistake
for any intelligent musician to have fallen into, in
the third quarter of the eighteenth century, if he had
concluded that Johann Sebastian Bach&rsquo;s career was a
failure, and that his influence upon the progress of his
art amounted to the minimum conceivable. Indeed, the
whole course of musical history in every branch went
straight out of the sphere of his activity for a long
while; his work ceased to have any significance to the
generation which succeeded him, and his eloquence fell
upon deaf ears. A few of his pupils went on writing
music of the same type as his in a half-hearted way,
and his own most distinguished son, Philipp Emanuel,
adopted at least the artistic manner of working up
his details and making the internal organization of his
works alive with figure and rhythm. But even he,
the sincerest composer of the following generation, was
infected by the complacent, polite superficiality of his
time; and he was forced, in accepting the harmonic
principle of working in its Italian phase, to take with
it some of the empty formulas and conventional tricks
of speech which had become part of its being, and
which sometimes seem to belie the genuineness of his
utterances and put him somewhat out of touch with
his whole-hearted father.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This passage from one of the most admirably
thought-out books on music I know, Sir Hubert Parry&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Evolution of the Art of Music,&rdquo; is no exaggeration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
For many years after Bach&rsquo;s death, for nearly a century
in fact, his influence was but little felt. And yet
so aptly does the development of art adjust itself to
human needs and aspirations, the very neglect into
which Bach fell turned music into certain channels
from which it derived the greater freedom of expression
essential to its progress and gave it the tinge of
romanticism which is the essence of modern music.</p>
<p>The greatness of Johann Sebastian Bach, on the technical
side at least, now is so universally acknowledged,
and professional musicians understand so well what
their art owes to him, we are apt to think of him as
the only musician of his day, whereas his significance
was but little appreciated by his contemporaries.
There were, in fact, other composers actively working
on other lines and turning music in the direction it was
destined to follow immediately after Bach&rsquo;s death&mdash;and
for its own ultimate good, be it observed. The simple
fact is, that pure counterpoint culminated in Bach.
What he accomplished was so stupendous that his successors
could not keep up with him. They became
exhausted before they even were prepared to begin
where he left off. And yet the reaction from Bach
was, as I have indicated, absolutely necessary to the
further progress of music.</p>
<p>The scheme of musical development which the reader
should bear in mind if he desires to understand music,
and to arrive at that understanding with some kind
of system in his progress, was briefly as follows:</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span></div>
<h4>Three Periods of Musical Development.</h4>
<p>First we have counterpoint, the welding together
of several themes each of equal importance. This style
of composition culminated in Bach. Its most elaborate
form of expression was the fugue; but it also employed
the canon and impressed into its service certain minor
forms like the allemande, courant, chaçonne, gavotte,
saraband, gigue, and minuet.</p>
<p>Next, after Bach music began to develop according
to the harmonic system, or, if I may be permitted for
the sake of clarity to use an expression which technically
is incorrect, according to the melodic system.
That is, instead of combining several themes, composers
took one theme or melody and supported it
with an accompaniment so that the melody stood out
in clear relief. This first decided melodic development
covers the classical period, the period after Bach to
Beethoven, and its highest form of expression was the
sonata, which in the orchestra became the symphony.</p>
<p>The romantic period comes after Beethoven. This,
to characterize it by the readiest means, by something
external, something the eye can see, is the &ldquo;single
piece&rdquo; period, the period in which the impromptu of
Schubert, the song without words of Mendelssohn, the
nocturne of Chopin, the novelette of Schumann, takes
the place of the sonata, which consists of a group of
pieces or movements. Composers begin to find a too
exacting insistence upon correctness of form irritating.
Expression becomes of more importance than form,
which is promptly violated if it interferes with the
composer&rsquo;s trend of thought or feeling. Pieces are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
written in certain moods, and their melody is developed
so as to follow and give full expression to the
mood in which it is conceived. New harmonies are
fearlessly invoked for the same purpose. Everything
centres in the idea that music exists not as an accessory
to form, but for the free expression of emotion.
In his useful and handy &ldquo;Dictionary of Musical
Terms,&rdquo; Theodore Baker defines a nocturne as a title
for a piano piece &ldquo;of a dreamily romantic or sentimental
character, but lacking a distinctive form.&rdquo; When we
see the title &ldquo;Sonata&rdquo; over a composition we think of
form. When we see the title &ldquo;Nocturne&rdquo; we think of
mood, not manner. The title arouses within us, by anticipation,
the very feeling, the very mood, the very
emotional condition which the composer is seeking to
express. The form in which he seeks to express it
is wholly a secondary matter. A composition is a
sonata because it follows a certain formal development.
It is a nocturne because it is &ldquo;dreamily romantic
or sentimental.&rdquo; In no better way, perhaps, could
the difference between the classical period of music
and the romantic period which set in after Beethoven
be explained. The romanticist is no more hampered
by form than the writer of poetry or fiction is by facts.
Form dominates feeling in classical music, feeling dominates
form in romantic music.</p>
<p>We still are and, happily, ever shall remain in the
romantic period. The greatest of all romanticists and,
up to the present time, the greatest of all composers is
Richard Wagner, whose genius will be appreciated
more and more as years go by until, as may be the
case, a still greater one will arise; although as dramatic
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span>
literature culminated in Shakespeare, so music may
have found its greatest master for all time in Wagner.
Wagner, of course, was not a composer for the pianoforte,
but when he reached back and to the fuller harmony
inherited from Beethoven added the counterpoint
of Bach, thus combining the two great systems of composition,
he indicated the only method of progress possible
for music of all kinds.</p>
<h4>Rise of the Melodic School.</h4>
<p>It must not be supposed that the melodic school
which came in after Bach and which, so far as the
classical form of the sonata is concerned, culminated
in Beethoven, was the mushroom growth of a night.
So much has been said of Bach that a person unfamiliar
with the history of music might draw the erroneous
conclusion that Bach was the only composer worth
mentioning before the classical period and Germany
the only country in which music had flourished. On
the contrary, Bach was the climax of a school to which
several countries had each contributed its share, partly
vocal, partly instrumental. Palestrina&rsquo;s name naturally
comes to mind as representative of the early period
of Italian church music; there also was the &ldquo;Belgian
Orpheus,&rdquo; Orlandus Lassus (or Lasso), the greatest
composer of the Flemish school; and England had its
Gibbons and other madrigal composers. Their music
was vocal and requires to be considered more thoroughly
under the head of vocal music, but it also was
contrapuntal and played its part in the general development
of the art before Bach came upon the scene. Of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
course, there also was instrumental music in counterpoint
before Bach&rsquo;s day. There is &ldquo;Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s
Virginal Book,&rdquo; a manuscript collection of music made
either during her reign or shortly afterward and containing
pieces for the virginal by Tallis, Bird, Giles,
Dr. John Bull and others, including also the madrigalist,
Gibbons. The Englishman, Henry Purcell
(1658-1695); the Frenchman, François Couperin
(1668-1733), who wrote a harpsichord method; the
Germans, Hans Leo von Hasler (1564-1612) and Froberger;
and the Italian, Frescobaldi&mdash;these were some
among many composers of counterpoint more or less
noted in their day.</p>
<p>Bach, however, brought the art of counterpoint to
perfection, so that, so far as it is concerned, he neither
required nor even so much as left room for a successor.
It may not be pertinent to the argument, yet it may
well be questioned whether, had the classical trio,
Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven, endeavored to carry
on the contrapuntal school, they would not, in spite of
their genius, have relegated music to a more primitive
state than it occupied when Bach died. It seems a
fortunate circumstance to me that Bach&rsquo;s son appears
to have realized his inferiority to his father and that, in
consequence, he turned from counterpoint to the development
of harmony&mdash;the working out of a clearly
defined theme or melody supported by accompaniment.</p>
<p>Counterpoint is said to be polyphonic, a term composed
of two Greek words signifying many-voiced, the
combination in music of several parts or themes. Opposed
to it is homophonic, or single-voiced, music, in
which one melody or part is supported by an accompaniment.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
Italy, with its genius for the sensuous and
emotional in music, already had developed a school of
melodic music, and to this Philipp Emanuel Bach turned
for a model. In Italy the pianoforte, through its employment
for the freer harmonic support of dramatic
solo singing in opera, an art form that is indigenous
to Italy, gradually had emancipated itself there from
counterpoint and acquired a style of its own. Girolamo
Frescobaldi (1583-1644), a famous Italian pianoforte
and organ virtuoso, whose first organ recital in
St. Peter&rsquo;s, Rome, is said to have attracted an audience
of thirty thousand, and whose mantle fell upon his two
most renowned pupils, the German, Johann Jacob Froberger,
and the Italian, Bernardo Pasquini, not only experimented
with our modern keys, seeking to replace
with them the old ecclesiastical modes in which Palestrina
wrote, but also simplified the method of notation.
For even what seems to us so simple a matter as the
five-line staff is the result of slow evolution.</p>
<h4>Scarlatti&rsquo;s Importance as Composer and Virtuoso.</h4>
<p>The Italian genius who gave the greatest impulse to
the progress of pianoforte music and who, for his day,
immensely improved the technique of pianoforte playing,
was Domenico Scarlatti (1683-1757), the famous
son of a famous father, Alessandro Scarlatti, the leading
dramatic composer of his time. Domenico Scarlatti
interests us especially because he is the only one
of the early Italians whose work retains an appreciable
foothold on modern recital programs. Von Bülow
edited selections from his works, and I recall from personal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
experience, because I was at the concert, the delight
with which some of these were received the first
time Von Bülow played them on his initial visit to this
country during the season of 1875-76. Amateurs on
the outlook for something new (even though it was
very old) took up Scarlatti, and this early Italian&rsquo;s suddenly
acquired popularity was comparable with the
&ldquo;run&rdquo; on the Rachmaninoff &ldquo;Prelude&rdquo; when it was
played here by Siloti many years later.</p>
<p>Scarlatti has been called the founder of modern
pianoforte technique. Although he composed for the
harpsichord, he understood the instrument so thoroughly
and what he wrote for it accords so well with
its genius, that by unconscious anticipation it also was
adapted to the genius of the modern pianoforte. It
still is pianistic; more pianistic and more suitable to
the modern repertoire than a good deal of music by
greater men who lived considerably later. I should
say, for example, that Scarlatti&rsquo;s name is found more
frequently on pianoforte recital programs than Mozart&rsquo;s,
although Mozart was incomparably the greater
genius. But there is about Scarlatti&rsquo;s music such a
quaint and primitive charm that one always listens to
it with the zest of a discoverer, whereas Mozart&rsquo;s pianoforte
music, although more modern, just misses being
modern enough. This clever Italian gives us the early
beginnings of the sonata form. He merely lisps in
sonata accents, it is true, but his lisp is as fascinating
as the ingenuous prattle of an attractive child. His best,
known work, &ldquo;The Cat&rsquo;s Fugue,&rdquo; the subject of which
is said to have been suggested to him by a cat gliding
over the keyboard, is indeed contrapuntal. But even
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
this is a movement in a sonata, and the characteristic
of his works as a whole is the fact that in most of them
he developed and worked out a melody or theme, and
that he established the fundamental outlines of the
sonata form.</p>
<p>Comparatively few laymen have more than a vague
idea of what is meant by sonata form. To them a
sonata simply is a composition consisting of several
movements, usually four, three of them of considerable
length, with a shorter one (a minuet or scherzo) between
the first and second or the second and fourth.
A sonata, however, must have one of its movements
(and generally it will be found to be the first) written
in a certain form. Regarding the Scarlatti sonatas,
suffice it to say here that with him the form still is in
its primitive simplicity. For example, the true sonata
movement as we now understand it employs two
themes, the second contrasting with the first. As a
rule, Scarlatti is content with one theme. It is the
peculiar merit of Philipp Emanuel Bach that he introduced
a second theme into his sonatas, or suggested it
by striking modulations when he employed only one
theme, and thus paved the way for its further elaboration
by Joseph Haydn. Mozart elaborated the form
still further, and then came Beethoven, with whom the
classical period reached its climax and whose sonatas
for all practical purposes have completely superseded
those of his forerunners.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span></div>
<h4>Rise of the Amateur.</h4>
<p>Characteristic of the period of transition from Bach
to Beethoven, from the fugue to the sonata, was the
development of popular interest in music. Scarlatti
begins a brief introduction to a collection of thirty of
his pianoforte pieces which were published in 1746, by
addressing the &ldquo;amateur or professor, whoever you be.&rdquo;
Significant in this is the inclusion of, in fact the seeming
preference given to the amateur. Music of the
counterpoint variety had been music for the church,
the court and the professional. Now, with the development
of the freer harmonic or melodic system, it
was growing more in touch with the people. During
Philipp Emanuel Bach&rsquo;s life the increase of popular interest
in music was remarkable. The titles that began
to appear on compositions show that composers were
reaching out for a larger public. Bie quotes some of
them: &ldquo;Cecilia Playing on the Pianoforte and Satisfying
the Hearing&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Busy Muse Clio&rdquo;; &ldquo;Pianoforte
Practice for the Delight of Mind and Ear, in Six
Easy <i>Galanterie Parties</i> Adapted to Modern Taste,
Composed Chiefly for Young Ladies&rdquo;; &ldquo;The Contented
Ear and the Quickened Soul&rdquo;; while Philipp Emanuel
Bach inscribes some of his pieces as &ldquo;easy&rdquo; or &ldquo;for
ladies.&rdquo; Evidently the &ldquo;young person&rdquo; figured as extensively
in the calculations of musical composers then
as she does now in those of the publishers of fiction.
Musical periodicals sprang up like mushrooms&mdash;&ldquo;Musical
Miscellany,&rdquo; &ldquo;Floral Garnerings for Pianoforte
Amateurs,&rdquo; &ldquo;New Music Journal for Encouragement
and Entertainment in Solitude at the Pianoforte for the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
Skilled and Unskilled,&rdquo; such were some of the titles.
These periodicals often went the way of most periodical
flesh and in the customary brief period, but they show a
quickened public interest in music&mdash;the &ldquo;contented ear
and the quickened soul,&rdquo; so to speak.</p>
<h4>Changes in Musical Taste.</h4>
<p>If I dismiss Philipp Emanuel Bach rather curtly and,
in this portion of the book at least, do the same with
Haydn and Mozart, this is not because I fail to appreciate
their importance in musical history, but because
they have failed to retain their hold on the modern
pianoforte repertoire. The simple fact is that the pianoforte
as an instrument has outgrown their music. We
can get more out of it than they gave it. If we bear
in mind that the pianoforte, as well as music itself, has
developed, it will aid us in understanding why so much
music, once considered far in advance of its time and
even revolutionary, has so soon become antiquated.
Why ignore facts? Some examples of primitive music
still survive because they charm us with their quaintness.
But the classical period is retiring more and
more into the shadow of history. Whatever importance
Haydn and Mozart may possess for the student,
their pianoforte music, so far as practical program-making
is concerned, is to-day a negligible quantity.
I remember the time when, as a pupil, I pored with
breathless interest over the pages of Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sonata
in A Minor&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Fantasy and Sonata in C Minor.&rdquo;
But to-day, when I read in a book published about
twenty-five years ago that Mozart indulged in harmonies,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
chord progressions and modulations, &ldquo;sometimes
considered of doubtful propriety even now&rdquo; and
&ldquo;quite as harshly censured as are to-day the similar
licenses of free-thinking composers&rdquo;&mdash;I wonder where
they are. For his own day, nevertheless, Mozart was
an innovator, as every genius is; for it is through those
daring deviations of genius from established rule and
tradition, which contemporaries regard as unjustifiable
license, that art progresses. This should be borne in
mind by those who were intolerant toward the opponents
of Wagner, yet now are guilty of a similar
solecism in proclaiming Richard Strauss a charlatan.</p>
<p>Assuming that the modern pianoforte pupil is but
indifferently nourished on the Mozart pabulum, let
me add that this composer also was a virtuoso, and
by his choice of the pianoforte over the clavichord did
much toward making the modern instrument more
popular. He also developed the sonata form so that
Beethoven found it ready moulded for his genius. In
fact the sonata form as we know it is so much a Mozart
creation that Mr. Hanchett, in his &ldquo;Art of the Musician,&rdquo;
suggests calling the sonata movement proper a
mozarta&mdash;a suggestion which I presume will never be
adopted.</p>
<h4>Beethoven and the Epoch of the Sonata.</h4>
<p>In the history of music there are three figures that
easily tower above the rest. Each represents an era.
They are Bach, who stands for counterpoint, the epoch
of the fugue; Beethoven, who represents the epoch of
the sonata; Wagner, who represents the epoch of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
music-drama. The first two summed up in themselves
certain art forms which others had originated. Bach&rsquo;s
root goes back to Palestrina, Beethoven&rsquo;s to Scarlatti.
Wagner presents the phenomenon of being both the
germ and the full fruition of the art form for which
he stands. It is conceivable that the work of these
men will at some time fall into desuetude, for in art
all things are possible, and the classical period seems
to be losing its grip on music more and more every day
and we ourselves may live to see the sonata movement
become obsolete. It certainly is having less and less
vogue, and a composer who now writes a sonata with
undeviating allegiance to its classical outlines, deliberately
invites neglect, because the listener no longer
cares to have his faculties of appreciation restricted by
too rigid insistence upon form, preferring that genius
should have the utmost latitude and be absolutely untrammeled
in giving expression to what it has to say.
Nevertheless, music always will bear the impress of
these three master minds, just as our language, although
we do not speak in blank verse, always will bear
the impress of Shakespeare. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of
that play,&rdquo; exclaimed the countryman, after hearing
&ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; for the first time. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all made up of quotations!&rdquo;
Equally familiar, not to say colloquial, are
certain musical phrases, certain modulations, which
have come down to us from the masters.</p>
<p>Although Beethoven no longer is the all-dominant
figure in the musical world that he was fifty years ago,
and it requires a performance of the &ldquo;Ninth Symphony&rdquo;
given under specially significant circumstances
(such as the conducting of a Felix Weingartner) to attract
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
as many to a concert hall as would be drawn by an
ordinary Wagner program, I trust I shall know how
to appreciate his importance to the development of musical
art and approach him with the reverence that is
his due. Like all great men who sum up an epoch, he
found certain things ready to hand. The Frenchman,
Jean Philippe Rameau (1683-1764), &ldquo;the creator of
the modern system of harmony,&rdquo; had published his
&ldquo;Nouveau Système de Musique Théorique&rdquo;; the sonata
movement from its tentative beginnings under Scarlatti
had been developed through Philipp Emanuel
Bach, Haydn and Mozart into a definite art form
awaiting the final test of a great genius&mdash;which Beethoven
proved to be.</p>
<h4>Beethoven&rsquo;s Slow Development.</h4>
<p>I already have pointed out that while pianoforte and
orchestra have developed side by side, the general belief
that the pianoforte merely has been the handmaiden
of the orchestra is a mistaken one. On the contrary,
until the end of the classical period, at least, the pianoforte
was the pioneer. It has blazed the way for the
orchestra and led it, instead of bringing up the rear.
Thus the sonata form was developed by the pianoforte
and then was handed over by that instrument to the
orchestra under the name of symphony, which, the
reader should bear in mind, simply is a sonata written
for orchestra instead of for the pianoforte. Even Beethoven,
before he composed his first symphony, which
is his Opus 21, tested his mastery of the form and his
ideas regarding certain further developments in it, by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
first composing thirteen pianoforte sonatas, including
the familiar &ldquo;Pathétique,&rdquo; which used to be to concert
programs what Liszt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2&rdquo;
is now&mdash;the <i>cheval de battaille</i>, on which pianists
pranced up and down before the ranks of their astonished
audiences and unfortunate amateurs sought to
retain their equilibrium.</p>
<p>This experimentation, this comparatively slow development,
was characteristic of Beethoven; is, in fact,
characteristic of every genius who works from the soul
outward. &ldquo;Like most artists whose spur is more in
themselves than in natural artistic facilities, he was
very slow to come to any artistic achievement,&rdquo; writes
Sir Hubert Parry. &ldquo;It is almost a law of things
that men whose artistic personality is very strong, and
who touch the world by the greatness and the power of
their expression, come to maturity comparatively late,
and sometimes grow greater all through their lives&mdash;so
it was with Bach, Gluck, Beethoven and Wagner&mdash;while
men whose aims are more purely artistic and
whose main spur is facility of diction, come to the
point of production early and do not grow much afterward.
Such composers as Mozart and Mendelssohn
succeeded in expressing themselves brilliantly at a very
early age; but their technical facility was out of proportion
to their individuality and their force of human
nature, and therefore there is no such surprising difference
between the work of their later years and the
work of their childhood as there is in the case of Beethoven
and Wagner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In writing sonatas Haydn and Mozart had been satisfied
with grace of outward form and a smooth and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
pretty flow of melody within that form. Beethoven
was a man of intellectual force as well as of musical
genius. He applied his intellect to enlarging the sonata
form, his musical genius to supplying it with contents
worthy of the greater opportunities he himself had
created for it. There is a wonderful union of mind
and heart in Beethoven&rsquo;s work. The sonata form, as
perfected by him, is a monument to his genius. It
remains to this day the flower of the classical period.</p>
<h4>The Passing of the Sonata.</h4>
<p>Nevertheless, the Beethoven sonatas no longer retain
the place of pre-eminence once accorded them on pianoforte
recital programs. When Von Bülow was in this
country during the season of 1875-76 he frequently
gave concerts at which he played only Beethoven
sonatas. I doubt if any of the great pianists of to-day
could now awaken as much public interest by such programs
as Von Bülow did. I remember the concert at
which, among others of the Beethoven sonatas, this virtuoso
played Opus 106 (&ldquo;Grosse Sonata für das Hammerklavier&rdquo;).
After he had played through part of
the first movement he became restless, and from time
to time peered over the keyboard and into the instrument
as if something were wrong with it. Finally he
broke off in the middle of the movement, rose from his
seat and walked off the stage. When he reappeared, he
had with him an attendant from the firm of manufacturers
whose pianofortes he used, and together they
fussed over the instrument for a while, before the attendant
made his exit and the irate little pianist began
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
the sonata all over again. We considered the mishap
that gave us opportunity to hear him play so much of
the work twice, a piece of great good luck for us.
Would we so consider it now?</p>
<p>Von Bülow has passed into musical history as a great
Beethoven player, and such he undoubtedly was. I
doubt, however, if he was a greater Beethoven player
than several living pianists. Some seasons ago Eugène
d&rsquo;Albert played a Beethoven program. His performance
did not evoke the enthusiasm he anticipated. In
fact there were intimations in the comments on his
performance that he was not as great a Beethoven
player as he thought he was. Personally, and having
a very clear recollection of Von Bülow&rsquo;s Beethoven
recitals, because I attended every one he gave in New
York, and in my mind&rsquo;s eye can see him sitting at the
pianoforte, bending away over, with his ear almost to
the keyboard, I think d&rsquo;Albert played his Beethoven
program quite as well. What had happened, however,
was this: A little matter of thirty years had passed
and with it the classical period and its efflorescence, the
sonata form, had faded by just so much, and by just
so much no longer was considered by the public the
crucial test of a pianist&rsquo;s musicianship. Incidentally it
is worth noting that the public usually is far ahead of
the profession and of the majority of critics in appreciating
new tendencies in music and in realizing what
is passing away; and the same thing probably prevails
in other arts.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span></div>
<h4>Orchestral Instead of Pianistic.</h4>
<p>I am aware that Beethoven was a pianist of the first
rank and that within the limitations of the sonata form
he developed the capacity of the pianoforte. I also
have read Richard Strauss&rsquo;s opinion, in his edition of
Berlioz&rsquo;s work on instrumentation, that Beethoven
treated the orchestra pianistically. Nevertheless, from
the modern viewpoint the essential fault of the sonata,
Beethoven&rsquo;s sonatas included, seems to me to be that
it is too orchestral and not sufficiently <i>claviermässig</i>
(pianistic) in character; not sufficiently adapted to the
genius of the pianoforte as we know it to-day. It is
possible that for the times in which they were composed,
the sonatas of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven
were most pianistic. But as music has become more
and more an intimate phase of life, and as our most
intimate instrument, the instrument of the household,
is the pianoforte, we understand its capacity for the
intimate expression of moods and fancies, the lights
and shadows of life, as it never was understood before.
The modern lover of music, if I may judge his standpoint
from my own, feels that while the sonatas of
the masters I have named were written for the pianoforte,
they were thought out for orchestra, and that
even a Beethoven sonata is an engraving for pianoforte
of a symphony for orchestra. He composed nine symphonies
and thirty-two sonatas. If he had written his
nine symphonies for pianoforte, we would have had
nine more sonatas. If he had composed his sonatas
for orchestra, we would have had thirty-two more symphonies.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>This orchestral (as opposed to pianistic) character
of the Beethoven sonatas accounts for passages in
them so awkwardly written for the instrument that
they are difficult to master, and yet, when mastered, are
not effective in proportion to their difficulty. Between
enlarging the capacity of an instrument through the
problems you give the player to solve and writing passages
that are awkwardly conceived for it, and hence
ineffectual after they have been mastered, there is a
great difference. Chopin, Liszt and others pile Pelion
on Ossa in their technical requirements of the pianist;
but when he has surmounted them, he has climbed a
mountain, and from its peak may watch the world at
his feet. I think the orchestral character of much that
Beethoven wrote for the pianoforte partly accounts for
the fact that his sonatas no longer attract the great virtuosos
as they formerly did and that the public no
longer regards them as the final test of a pianist&rsquo;s rank.</p>
<p>I speak so unreservedly because I have lived through
the change of taste myself. By way of personal explanation
I may be permitted to say, that while I am
not a professional musician, music was so much a
part of my life that I studied the pianoforte almost
as assiduously as if I had intended becoming a
public player, and that I was proficient enough to
meet once a week with the first violinist and the first
violoncellist of the New York Philharmonic Society
for the practice of chamber music. If there is any one
who should worship at the shrine of the sonata form,
and especially at that of the Beethoven sonatas, it should
be myself, for I was brought up on the form and those
sonatas were my daily bread. When I went to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span>
Von Bülow Beethoven recitals it was with book in hand,
to follow what he played note for note for purposes of
study and assimilation. Those were years when, in
the hours during which one seeks communion with
one&rsquo;s other self, the Beethoven sonatas were the medium
of communication. But now&mdash;give me the men who
emancipated themselves from a form that fettered the
individuality of the pianoforte, Chopin, Liszt, Schumann,
and the pianoforte scores of the Wagner music-dramas,
which actually sound more pianistic than the
sonatas of the classical period and in which it is a
delight to plunge oneself and be borne along on a flood
of free, exultant melody.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the sonata has had a great part to play
in the history and development of music and has played
it nobly, and we must no more forget this than we
should allow present-day hero worship to supplant the
memory of the heroes who went before. The sonata is
the firm and solid bridge over which music passed from
the contrapuntal period to the romantic, and doubtless
there still are some who prefer to linger on the bridge
rather than cross it to the promised land to which it
leads. Always there are conservatives who stand still
and look back; and that these still should let their eyes
rest longingly on the great master of the classical
epoch, Beethoven, is, to say the least, comprehensible.
One would have to be unresponsive indeed not to be
thrilled by the story of his life&mdash;his force of character,
his rugged personality, his determination in spite of
one of the greatest misfortunes that could befall a
musician, deafness; and the intellectual power which
he displayed in bending a seemingly rigid art form to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
his will and making it the receptacle of his inspiration.</p>
<p>Well may these considerations be borne in mind
whenever a Beethoven sonata is on a pianoforte recital
program. If it does not move us as profoundly
as music more modern does, that is not because its
composer was less deeply concerned with the problems
of life than those who have come after him. For his
time he was wonderfully &ldquo;subjective,&rdquo; drawing his
inspiration from the heart, yet always preserving a sane
mental poise. If to-day the sonatas of this great genius
and splendid man seem to us less dramatic and emotional
than they once did to audiences, it is because
of the progress of music toward greater plasticity of
expression and our conviction that such should be its
mission.</p>

<h2>IV</h2>
<h3>DAWN OF THE ROMANTIC PERIOD</h3>
</div>
<p>All art begins with a groping after form, then attains
form, and then emancipates itself from too
great insistence upon rigidity of form without,
however, reverting to its early formless condition. It
was absolutely necessary to the establishment of music
as an art that at some period or periods in its development
it should &ldquo;pull itself together&rdquo; and focus itself
in certain forms, and adhere to them somewhat rigidly
and somewhat tenaciously until they had been perfected.</p>
<p>Without saying so in as many words, I have sought,
in speaking of the sonata, to let the modern lover of
music know that if he does not like sonatas he need
not be ashamed of that fact. A few minutes ago and
before writing this sentence, I left my desk and going
to the pianoforte, played through Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sonata
Pathétique.&rdquo; It used to be a thrilling experience to play
it or to hear it played. To-day the Grave which introduces
the first movement still seemed portentous,
the individual themes throughout the work had lost
none of their beauty. And yet the effect produced in
earlier years by this sonata as a whole was lacking. I
shall not say that it sounded pedantic, for I dislike to
apply that word to anything that sprang from the heart
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
and brain of a genius like Beethoven&rsquo;s, but there was
a feeling of restraint about it&mdash;the restraint of set
form, the restraint of pathos patterned to measure,
which is incompatible with our modern notions of absolute
freedom of expression in music. Moreover, there
is ample evidence that Beethoven himself chafed under
the restraint of the sonata form and constantly strove
to make it more elastic and more yielding to his inspiration.</p>
<h4>What a Sonata Is.</h4>
<p>The sonata form (that is to say, the movement from
which the sonata derives its name) consists of three
main divisions and can easily be studied by securing the
Bülow and Lebert edition of the Beethoven sonatas in
Schirmer&rsquo;s library, in which the various divisions and
subdivisions are indicated as they occur in the music.
The first division (sometimes with a slow introduction
like the Grave of the &ldquo;Sonata Pathétique&rdquo;) may be
called the exposition. It consists of the main theme in
the key of the piece, a connecting episode, a second
theme in a related key and contrasting with the first,
and a concluding passage. As a rule the exposition is
repeated&mdash;an extremely artificial proceeding, since
there is no esthetic or psychological reason for it.</p>
<p>After the exposition comes the second division, the
development or &ldquo;working out,&rdquo; a treatment of both
themes with much figuration and imitation, generally
called the &ldquo;free fantasia&rdquo; and consisting &ldquo;chiefly of a
free development of motives taken from the first part&rdquo;
(Baker). This leads into the third division, which is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span>
a restatement of the first, excepting that the second
theme, instead of being in a related key, is, like the
main theme, in the tonic.</p>
<h4>How Beethoven Enlarged the Form.</h4>
<p>This is the form of the sonata movement which was
handed down to Beethoven by Haydn and Mozart. It
very soon became apparent that the greatest genius of
the classical period found it too limited for his inspiration.
In his third sonata (Opus 2, No. 3) he makes
several innovations that, for their day, are most daring.
Following the first episode after the main theme,
he introduces a second episode with which he leads
into the second theme. Then using a variant of the
first episode as a connection he leads over to a third,
a closing theme. In fact, the material of the second
episode is so thematic that I see no reason why he
should not be said to use four themes in the exposition
instead of the customary two. In the free fantasia
he insistently reiterates the main theme, practically ignoring
the others, thus familiarizing the listener with
it and making it as welcome as an old friend when the
third division ushers it in again.</p>
<p>Instead of closing the movement at the end of the
usual third division, as his predecessors, Haydn and
Mozart, did, Beethoven introduces what is one of the
most important innovations grafted by him upon the
sonata form&mdash;a coda with a cadenza. I can imagine
that this movement made his contemporaries look
dubious and shake their heads. It must have seemed
to them originality strained to the point of eccentricity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span>
and more bizarre than effective. As we look back upon
it, after this long lapse of time, it must be reckoned
a most brilliant achievement in the direction of freer
form, and from this point of view&mdash;please bear in mind
the reservation&mdash;its creator not only never surpassed
it, but frequently fell behind it.</p>
<p>One of the movements of this sonata is a scherzo.
Beethoven is the creator of this style of movement.
It is much less formal than the minuet which Haydn
introduced into the sonata. This especial scherzo has
a trio which in the broad sweep of its arpeggios is as
modern sounding as anything Beethoven wrote for
the pianoforte.</p>
<h4>His &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>There are other sonatas by Beethoven that indicate
efforts on his part to be less trammeled by considerations
of form. Regard as an example the &ldquo;Sonata Quasi
Una Fantasia,&rdquo; Opus 27, No. 2, generally, and by
no means inaptly, called the &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata.&rdquo; This
begins with the broad and beautiful slow movement,
with its sustained melody, a poem of profound pathos
in musical accents. It is followed by an Allegretto, &ldquo;<i>une
fleur entre deux abîmes</i>&rdquo; (a flower &rsquo;twixt two abysses)
Liszt called it; and then comes the concluding movement,
a Presto agitato, which is one of Beethoven&rsquo;s
most impassioned creations. There are only three movements,
and the usual sequence is inverted, for the last
of the three is the Sonata movement. At the end of
the Adagio sostenuto and at the end of the Allegretto
as well, is the direction &ldquo;<i>attacca subito il sequente</i>,&rdquo; indicating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span>
that the following movement is to be attacked
at once and denoting an inner relationship, a psychological
connection between the three movements. Throughout
the work the themes are of extraordinary beauty
and expressiveness even for a Beethoven and the whole
is a genuine drama of human life and experience. This
impression is produced not only by the very evident
psychological connection between the movements, but
by the manner in which the composer holds on to his
themes, developing them through bar after bar as if
he himself appreciated their beauty and were reluctant
to let go of them and introduce new material. The entire
first movement, practically a song without words
of the most exquisite poignancy, is built on a single
motive with a brief episode which is more like an improvisation
than a set part of a movement; while the
last movement consists of four eloquent themes with
only the merest suggestion of connecting episodes.
The working out in the last movement is almost
wholly a persistent iteration of the second theme.
This persistent dwelling upon theme and the
psychological relation between the different movements
make this &ldquo;Moonlight Sonata&rdquo; to me the
most modern sounding of Beethoven&rsquo;s pianoforte
works, although when mere structural greatness is considered,
most critics will incline to rank it lower than
the &ldquo;Sonata Appassionata&rdquo; and the four last sonatas,
Op. 106 and 109-11. Undoubtedly, however, it is the
most &ldquo;temperamental&rdquo; of his sonatas&mdash;and herein
again the most modern. My one quarrel with Von
Bülow is that he made it so popular by his frequent
playing of it and his exceptionally poetic interpretation
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span>
of it, that the great virtuosos shun it, very much
as they shun the sixth Chopin waltz (Mme. Dudevant&rsquo;s
dog chasing its own tail), because it is played by every
pianoforte pupil of every girls&rsquo; boarding school everywhere.</p>
<h4>Striving for Freedom.</h4>
<p>In addition to what I have said of this sonata, it
was an immense gain for greater freedom of form, and
it is to be regretted that it is a more or less isolated
instance and that Beethoven did not adopt it as a standard
in shaping his remaining sonatas. Its most valuable
attribute from the modern point of view is a characteristic
to which I already have called attention several
times&mdash;the fact that its several movements stand
in psychological relation to one another; that there is
such real soul or temperamental connection between
them, that it would be doing actual violence to the work
as a whole if any one movement were to be played without
the others or if their sequence were to be inverted.</p>
<p>But, you may ask, is there not in all sonatas this
psychological inter-relationship of the several movements?
Have we not been told again and again that
there is?</p>
<p>Undoubtedly you, and others who have been misinformed
by enthusiasts who are unable to hear music
in anything that has been composed since Beethoven,
have been told so. But the sonata, with a few exceptions
like the &ldquo;Moonlight,&rdquo; simply is a group usually of
four movements, three long-ones with a shorter one
between, and, save for their being in related keys, there
is no temperamental relationship between the movements
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
whatsoever, and to talk of there being such a
thing is nonsense. I believe the time will come when
virtuosos will not hesitate to lift single movements out
of the Beethoven sonatas and place them on their programs
and that there will be a sigh of relief from the
public because it can hear a movement that still sounds
fresh and modern without being obliged to listen to
two or three others that do not. Heresy? Maybe.
Galileo was accounted a heretic&mdash;yet the world moves
and the musical world with it.</p>
<h4>The Beethoven Periods.</h4>
<p>Beethoven was an intellectual as well as a musical
giant. He thought before he wrought. The division
of his activity into three periods, in each of which he
is supposed to have progressed further along the road
of originality and greatness, is generally accepted.
Nevertheless, it is an arbitrary one, especially as
regards the pianoforte sonatas, since it has been
seen that the first movement of one of his
earliest works, the third sonata (Opus 2, No.
3), is one of his most original contributions
to music, and one of the most strikingly developed
movements in sonata form that he has given us. The
period division which assigns this sonata as well as the
&ldquo;Sonata Pathétique&rdquo; to the first period is absurd. The
fact is, that the works of the so-called first and second
periods overlap; but there is a decided change in his
style when we come to his third period which, in the
pianoforte sonatas, begins with Opus 109. (The beginning
of this period usually is assigned to the sonata
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
Opus 101, which seems to me too early.) Because here
a restless spirit seems to be brooding over his work, it
is thought by some that his mind and heart were
warped by his misfortunes&mdash;his deafness, the ingratitude
of a worthless nephew to whom he had been as
a father, and other family and material troubles. To
me, however, Beethoven seems in these sonatas to be
chafing more and more under the restraint of form and
to be struggling to free himself from it, bending all
his intellect to the task. Frankly, I do not think that
in these last sonatas he achieved his purpose. He
had outgrown the form he himself had perfected, and
the thoughts which toward the last he endeavored to
mould in it called for absolutely free and untrammeled
development. He had become too great for it and, as
a result, it cramped and hampered him in his latest
utterances. It is my firm belief that had Beethoven
come upon the scene fifty years later, he would not
have composed a single sonata, but have revived the
suite in modern style, as Schumann practically did in
his &ldquo;Carnaval,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kreisleriana,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Faschingschwank
aus Wien,&rdquo; or have created for the pianoforte something
corresponding to the freely developed tone poems
of Richard Strauss.</p>
<p>Because, however, Beethoven wrote thirty-two pianoforte
sonatas and because he was for many years the
all-dominating figure in the musical world, every great
composer who came after him and composed for the
pianoforte experimented with the sonata form, and
always, be it noted, with less success and less importance
to the real progress of music toward freedom
of expression than when he followed his own inner impulse
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span>
and wrote the mood pieces, the &ldquo;music of intention,&rdquo;
the subjective expressions of indicated thoughts
and feelings, that were more consonant with the tendencies
of the romantic period which followed Beethoven
and for which he may be said to have paved
the way. For just as Bach brought the contrapuntal
form to such perfection that those who came after
him could not even begin where he left off, let alone
surpass him, so Beethoven brought the sonata form to
such perfection that no further advance in it was possible.
No wonder therefore that the pianoforte sonatas
of the romanticists are comparatively few in number
and the least satisfactory of their works. These composers
seem to have written sonatas simply to show
that they could write them and under a mistaken idea
that length is a measure of greatness and that shorter
pieces are minor achievements, whereas as much genius
can be displayed in a nocturne as in a sonata.</p>
<h4>Sonatas Now Old-fashioned.</h4>
<p>Lawrence Gilman, one of our younger American
critics, in his &ldquo;Phases of Modern Music,&rdquo; a collection
of essays, brief but containing a wealth of suggestion
and breathing throughout the spirit of modernity,
sums up the matter in speaking of Edward MacDowell&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Keltic Sonata&rdquo;: &ldquo;I cannot help wishing
that he might contrive some expedient for doing away,
so far as he himself is concerned, with the sonata form
which he occasionally uses, rather inconsistently, as a
vehicle for the expression of that vision and emotion
that are in him; for, generally speaking, and in spite of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
the triumphant success of the &lsquo;Keltic,&rsquo; Mr. MacDowell
is less fortunate in his sonatas than in those freer and
more elastically wrought tone poems in which he voices
a mood or an experience with epigrammatic concision
and directness. The &lsquo;Keltic&rsquo; succeeds in spite of its
form, ... though even here, and notwithstanding
the freedom of manipulation, one feels that he
would have worked to still finer ends in a more flexible
and fluent form. He is never so compelling, so persuasively
eloquent, as in those impressionistically conceived
pieces in which he moulds his inspiration upon
the events of an interior emotional program, rather
than upon a musical formula necessarily arbitrary and
anomalous.&rdquo; This applies to pianoforte music in general
since Beethoven. Such I believe to be the consensus
of opinion among the younger generation of
critics, to whom, after all, the future belongs, as well
as the opinion of those older critics who refuse to allow
themselves to be pitchforked by their years into the
ranks of the old fogies and who still hold themselves
ever receptive to every new manifestation in music that
is based on a union of mind and heart.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise specifically mentioned I have, in
speaking of the sonata form, referred to it in connection
with the pianoforte. But it also is the form employed
for the symphony (which simply is a sonata
for orchestra); for pianoforte trios, quartets and quintets;
for string quartets and other branches of
chamber music (which are sonatas written for the combination
of instruments mentioned and such others
as are employed in chamber music), and for concertos
(which are sonatas for the combination of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
solo instrument like the pianoforte, violin or violoncello,
with orchestra). In these branches the sonata
form has held its own more successfully than on the
pianoforte, and for several extraneous reasons. In the
symphony it is due largely to the greater variety that
can be achieved through orchestral coloring; in chamber
music largely to the somewhat super-refined and
timorous taste of its devotees which would regard any
startling innovation as highly indecorous; and in the
concerto to the fact that a soloist who appears at an
orchestral concert is supposed to play a concerto simply
because the orchestra is there to play it with him, although
he, as well as the audience, probably would find
a group of solos far more effective. In fact I think
that much of the applause which usually follows a great
pianist&rsquo;s playing of a concerto is due not so much to
the audience&rsquo;s enthusiasm over it as to the hope that
he may be induced to come out and play something
alone. So far as the symphony is concerned, it is liberating
itself more and more from the sonata form and
taking the direction indicated by Liszt in his symphonic
poems and by Richard Strauss in his tone poems,
the freest form of orchestral composition yet conceived.</p>
<h4>The First Romantic Composers.</h4>
<p>In music, as in other arts, periods overlap. We have
seen that during Bach&rsquo;s life Scarlatti in Italy was laying
the foundations of the harmonic system and shaping
the outlines of the sonata form which was to develop
through Philipp Emanuel Bach, Haydn and Mozart
and find its greatest master in Beethoven. Likewise,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
even while Beethoven was creating those works which
are the glory of the classical period, two of his contemporaries,
Carl Maria von Weber, who died one year
before him, and Franz Schubert, who survived him
by only a year, were writing music which was destined
to turn the art into new channels. Weber (1786-1826)
is indeed regarded as the founder of the romantic
school through his opera &ldquo;Der Freischütz.&rdquo; It seems to
me, however, that Schubert (1797-1828) contributed
quite as much to the new movement through his songs,
while the contributions of both to the pianoforte are
important. Weber was a finished pianist, had an enormous
reach (he could stretch a twelfth), and besides
utilizing the facility thus afforded him to add to the
brilliancy of pianoforte technique (as in his well-known
&ldquo;Concert Piece for Piano and Orchestra&rdquo;), he deliberately,
in some of his compositions, ignored the sonata
form and wrote a &ldquo;Momento Capriccioso,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Polonaise,&rdquo;
a &ldquo;Rondo Brilliant,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Polacca Brilliant&rdquo; and
the fascinating &ldquo;Invitation to the Dance.&rdquo; The last,
even in its original form and without the elaborations
in Tausig&rsquo;s version of it, and the &ldquo;Concert Piece&rdquo; still
are brilliant and effective numbers in the modern pianoforte
repertoire. Considering the age in which they
were composed, their freedom from pedantry is little
short of marvelous.</p>
<h4>Schubert&rsquo;s Pianoforte Music.</h4>
<p>Schubert was not a virtuoso and passed his life almost
in obscurity, but we now recognize that, although
he lived but thirty-one years, few composers wrought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
more lastingly than he. Of course, the proper place for
an estimate of his genius is in the chapter on song, but
as a pianoforte composer he is, even to this day, making
his influence more and more felt. Living in Vienna,
Beethoven&rsquo;s city, and a fervent admirer of that genius,
it was natural that he should have composed sonatas,
and there is a whole volume of them among his pianoforte
works. Nevertheless, so original was his genius
and so fertile, that, in addition to his numerous other
works, he composed eight impromptus, among them
the highly poetic one in G flat major (Opus 42, No. 2),
usually called &ldquo;The Elegy&rdquo;; another in B flat major
(Opus 142, No. 3), which is a theme with variations,
some of them brilliant, others profoundly expressive;
and the beautifully melodious one in A flat major; six
dainty &ldquo;Moments Musicals&rdquo;; the exquisite little waltz
melodies from which Liszt fashioned the &ldquo;Soirées de
Vienne&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Fantasia in G,&rdquo; from which the popular
minuet is taken; and the broadly dramatic &ldquo;Fantasia&rdquo;
on a theme from his song, &ldquo;The Wanderer,&rdquo; for which
Liszt wrote an orchestral obbligato, thus converting it
into a highly effective and thoroughly modern fantasy
for pianoforte and orchestra. These detached compositions
are as eloquent in their appeal to-day as if they
had been written during the last ten years instead of
during the first quarter of the last century. They are
melodious with the sustained melody that delights the
modern ear. There is not, as in the sonata form or,
for that matter, in all the classical music that Schubert
heard around him, the brief giving out of a theme, then
an episode, then another brief theme and so on, all
couched in the formulas in which the classicists delighted,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
but instead of these postulates of formality,
melody fully developed and wrought out by one who
reveled in it and was willing that his hearers should
revel in it as well. To distinguish between the classicists
and this early romantic composer, whose work survives
in all its freshness and beauty to this day, it may be
said that their music was thematic&mdash;based on the kind
of themes that lent themselves to formal working out
as prescribed by the sonata formula; whereas these detached
pieces of Schubert are based on melodies&mdash;long-drawn-out
melodies, if you wish, and be grateful that
they are&mdash;that conjure up mood pictures and through
their exquisite harmonization exhale the very fragrance
of romanticism.</p>
<p>Naturally, the sonatas from his pen are more set.
Nevertheless, so long as it seems that we must have
sonatas on our recital programs, the neglect of those
by Schubert is shameful. I am willing to stake his
sonata No. 5, in A minor, against any sonata ever written,
and from several of the sonatas single movements
can be detached which I should think any pianist would
be glad to add to his repertoire. Among these is the
lithesome scherzo from the sonata No. 10, in B flat
major, and the beautiful slow movement (Andante sostenuto)
from the same work.</p>
<p>Schubert also wrote many valuable pianoforte duets,
among them several sets of marches and polonaises and
an elaborate and stirring &ldquo;Divertissement à l&rsquo;Hongroise,&rdquo;
which last seems to foreshadow the
&ldquo;Hungarian Rhapsodies&rdquo; of Liszt. In these and
the detached pianoforte solo pieces a special value
lies in that they do not appear to have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
composed as a protest against the sonata form, but
spontaneously and without a thought on Schubert&rsquo;s
part that he was doing anything in any way
remarkable. They are expressions of musical feeling
in the manner that appealed to him as most natural.
The &ldquo;Moments Musicals&rdquo; especially are little mood
pieces and impressionistic sketches with here and there
a bit of realism. Who, for example, is apt to forget
Essipoff&rsquo;s playing of the third &ldquo;Moment&rdquo; in Hungarian
style, with a long crescendo and diminuendo (the same
effect used by Rubinstein, when he played his arrangement
of the &ldquo;Turkish March&rdquo; from Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ruins
of Athens&rdquo;), so that it seemed as if a band of gypsies
approached from afar, danced by, and vanished in the
distance? Thoroughly modern is Schubert, a most
modern of the moderns, whether we listen to his original
pianoforte compositions, or to the Schubert-Liszt
waltzes, or &ldquo;Hark, Hark, the Lark,&rdquo; &ldquo;To Be Sung on
the Water&rdquo; (barcarolle) and other songs of his which
have been arranged for the pianoforte by Liszt.</p>
<h4>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Songs Without Words.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>Felix Mendelssohn-Bartholdy, the musical idol of his
day and now correspondingly neglected, contributed to
the romantic movement his &ldquo;Songs Without Words,&rdquo;
short pieces for the pianoforte and aptly named because
their sustained melody clearly defined against a purposely
subordinated accompaniment gives them the
character of songs, in the popular meaning of the word.
Mendelssohn was a fluent, gentlemanly composer,
whose music was readily understood and therefore attained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
immediate popularity. But the very qualities
that made it popular&mdash;its smoothness and polish and
its rather commonplace harmlessness&mdash;have caused it
to lose caste. The &ldquo;Songs Without Words,&rdquo; however,
still occupy a place in the music master&rsquo;s curriculum,
forming a graceful and easily crossed bridge from classical
to romantic music. I can remember still, when,
as a lad, I received from my music teacher my first
Mendelssohn &ldquo;Song Without Words,&rdquo; the G minor barcarolle,
how it seemed to open up a new world of music
to me. Many of these compositions, which are unique
in their way, still will be found to possess much merit.
That they are polished little pieces and poetic in feeling
almost goes without saying. The &ldquo;Spring Song&rdquo;
may be one of the most hackneyed of pianoforte pieces
and the same may be true of the &ldquo;Spinning Song,&rdquo; but
it is equally true that the former is as graceful and
charming as the latter is brilliant and showy. A tender
and expressive little lyric is the one in F major (No.
22), which Joseffy frequently used as an encore and
played with exquisite effect. A group of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Songs Without Words&rdquo; is never out of place on
a pianist&rsquo;s program. At least half a dozen of them, I
think, are apt to survive the vicissitudes of many years
to come. Mendelssohn wrote three sonatas, a &ldquo;Sonata
Ecossaies&rdquo; (Scotch), several capriccios and other pieces
for the pianoforte, besides two pianoforte concertos, of
which the one in G minor is the stock selection of conservatory
pupils at their graduation exercises and later
at their début. With it they shoot the musical
chutes.</p>

<a name='V_CHOPIN_THE_POET_OF_THE_PIANOFORTE' id='V_CHOPIN_THE_POET_OF_THE_PIANOFORTE'></a>
<h2>V</h2>
<h3>CHOPIN, THE POET OF THE PIANOFORTE</h3>
</div>
<p>I must ask the reader still to imagine that he is
at a pianoforte recital, although I frankly admit
that I have been guilty of many digressions, so
that it must appear to him as if he had been whisked
from Mendelssohn Hall up to Carnegie Hall, then
down to the Metropolitan Opera House and back to
Mendelssohn Hall again. This, however, as I have
sought to make clear before, is due to the universality
of the pianoforte as an instrument and to the comprehensiveness
of pianoforte music, which in itself illustrates
in great part the development of the art.</p>
<p>At this point, then, of our imaginary pianoforte recital
there is likely to be a group of compositions by
Chopin; and the larger the group, or the more groups
by this composer on the program, the better satisfied
the audience is apt to be. Baker calls Frédéric Chopin
(1810-1849) the &ldquo;incomparable composer for the pianoforte.&rdquo;
But he was more. He was an incomparable
composer from every point of view, great, unique, a
tone poet, as well as the first composer who searched
the very soul of the instrument for which he specialized.
Extraordinary as is his significance for that instrument,
his influence extends through it into other
realms of music, and his art is making itself felt to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
this day in orchestra, opera and music-drama as well
as in pianoforte music. For he was an innovator in
form, an intrepid adventurer in harmony and a sublime
singer of melody.</p>
<h4>Tempo Rubato.</h4>
<p>Before the pianist whose recital we are supposed to
be attending will have played many bars of the first
piece in the Chopin group, the individuality of this
composer will become apparent. Melody will pervade
the recital hall like the fragrance of flowers. At the
same time there will be an iridescence not noticeable
in any of the music that preceded Chopin, and produced
as if by cascades of jewels&mdash;those remarkable ornamental
notes which yet are not ornamental, but, in
spite of all their light and shade, and their play of
changeable colors, part of the great undercurrent
of melody itself. Here we have then, nearly at the
very outset of the first Chopin piece, the famous <i>tempo
rubato</i>, so-called, which has been explained in various
ways, but which with Chopin really means that while
the rhythm goes calmly on with one hand, the other
weaves a veil of iridescent notes around the melodic
idea. Liszt expressed it exactly when he said: &ldquo;You
see that tree? Its leaves move to and fro in the wind
and follow the gentle motion of the air; but its trunk
stands there immovable in its form.&rdquo; Or the <i>tempo
rubato</i> is like a shower of petals from a tree in full
bloom; the firm outline of the tree, its foliage are there,
while we see the delicately tinted blossoms falling from
the branches and filling the air with color and fragrance;
or like the myriad shafts from the facets of a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
jewel, piercing in all directions while the jewel itself
remains immovable, the centre of its own rays; or like
the crisp ripple on a river, while the stream itself flows
on in majesty; or, in one or two passages when Chopin
becomes a cynic, like the twaddle of critics while the
person they criticise calmly goes about his mission.</p>
<h4>The Soul of the Pianoforte.</h4>
<p>What you will notice about these compositions of
Chopin&mdash;and I say &ldquo;these compositions&rdquo; deliberately,
although I have not named any (for it makes no difference
what pieces of his are on the program, the effect
will be the same)&mdash;is the fact that in none of them is
there the slightest suggestion of anything but pianoforte
music. Chopin&rsquo;s great achievement so far as the
pianoforte is concerned is the fact that he liberated it
completely from orchestral and choral influences, and
made it an instrument sufficient unto itself, brought it
into its own in all its beauty of tone and expression
and enlarged its capacity; sought out its soul and reproduced
it in tone, as no other composer had done before
him or has done since. The recognition of the true
piano tone seems to have been instinctive with him.
It appears in his earliest works. Nothing he ever
wrote suggests orchestra or voice. For the beautiful
singing quality he brings out in much of his music is
a singing quality which belongs to the noble instrument
to which he devoted himself. Not once while listening
to a Chopin composition do you think to yourself, as
you do so often with classical works, like the Beethoven
sonatas, &ldquo;How well this would sound on the orchestra!&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
Yet Chopin is as sonorous, as passionate, as
pleading, as melancholy and as rich in effect, although
he is played only on the black and white keys of the
pianoforte, as if he were given forth by a hundred
instrumentalists, so thoroughly did he understand the
instrument for which he wrote. He was the Wagner
of the pianoforte.</p>
<h4>A Clear Melodic Line.</h4>
<p>What you will notice, too, about his music is the general
distinctness of his melody. There may be times,
as in some of his arabesque compositions, like the &ldquo;F
Minor Étude,&rdquo; when the effect is slightly blurred. But
this is done purposely, and as a rule there will be found
a clear melodic line running through everything he
wrote. Combined with this melody are weird, exquisite,
entrancing harmonies, and those showers of
<i>tempo rubato</i> notes which glitter like a veil of mist in
the sunlight and yet, although a veil, allow you to see
what is beneath it, like a delicate fabric which seems
rather to emphasize and reveal the very things it is
intended to conceal.</p>
<p>Chopin was a Pole. He had the melancholy of his
race, but also its <i>verve</i>. Profoundly affected by his
country&rsquo;s sorrow, he also had its haughty spirit. In
Paris, where he spent the most significant years of his
life, he was surrounded by the aristocracy of his own
country who were in exile, and by the aristocracy of
the arts. Liszt speaks of an evening at his salon where
he met, besides some of the Polish aristocrats, people
like Heinrich Heine, Meyerbeer, Delacroix, Nourrit,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
the tenor, and Bellini. Chopin admired Bellini&rsquo;s music,
its clear and beautiful melodiousness, and I myself
think that Chopin&rsquo;s melody often has Italian characteristics,
although it is combined with harmony that
is German in its seriousness, but wholly Chopinesque
in all its essentials. In those numerous groups of
ornamental, or rather semi-ornamental, notes, so many
of them chromatic, and all of them usually designated
by the technical term &ldquo;passing notes,&rdquo; signifying that
they are merely incidental to the melody and to the
harmonic structure, there are nevertheless many that
have far greater importance than if they were merely
&ldquo;passing.&rdquo; It is in bringing out this significance by
slight accelerations and retards, by allowing a few of
them to flash out here while the others remain slightly
veiled, that the inspired Chopin player shows his true
conception of what the composer meant by <i>tempo
rubato</i>.</p>
<p>It was Liszt, afterward the first to recognize Wagner,
who was the first to recognize Chopin. It was
Liszt also who introduced him to George Sand (Mme.
Dudevant), the great passion of his life. Chopin was
the friend of many women. They adored his poetic
nature, and there is much in his music that is effeminate,
delicate and sensitive; but altogether too much
has been made of this side of his art, and of certain
morbid pieces like some of the Nocturnes. The affair
with George Sand was not only a passion, but was a
tragedy, and like all such tragedies it left on his music
the imprint of something deeper and greater than mere
delicacy and morbidity. Then, too, we have to count
with his patriotism and his sympathy with his struggling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
country, and there is much more of the virile
and heroic in his music than either the average virtuoso
or the average listener allows for.</p>
<h4>The Études.</h4>
<p>These contrasts in his music can readily be recognized
when a great pianist makes up the Chopin group
on his program from the Études, which are among
the greatest compositions of all times, whether we consider
them as pianoforte music or as music in general.
They touch the soul in many places, and in many and
varied ways, and they reflect the alternate delicacy and
daintiness of his genius as well as its vigor and nobility.
Suppose, for the sake of a brilliant beginning, the
virtuoso chooses to start off with the fifth, the so-called
&ldquo;Étude on Black Keys,&rdquo; and flashes it in our
eyes, making the pianoforte play the part of a mirror
held in the sunlight. This gives us one side of Chopin&rsquo;s
music, its brilliancy; and it is noticeable that while
the tempo of the piece is given as <i>vivace</i>, the style in
which it is to be played is indicated by the direction
<i>brillante</i>.</p>
<p>If the pianist continues with the third Étude, we
shall hear one of the most tender and beautiful melodies
that Chopin ever composed. Let him follow this with
number thirteen, the one in A flat major, and we are
reminded of what Schumann said, in his review of
this book of Études, in which he speaks of the A flat
major as &ldquo;an &aelig;olian harp, possessed of all the musical
scales, the hand of the artist causing them all to intermingle
in many varieties of fantastic embellishment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
yet in such a way as to leave everywhere audible a deep
fundamental tone and a soft continuously singing
upper voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schumann heard Chopin himself play this Étude, and
he says that whoever will play it in the way described
will get the correct idea of Chopin&rsquo;s performance. &ldquo;But
it would be an error to think that Chopin permitted
every one of the small notes to be distinctly heard. It
was rather an undulation of the A flat major chord
here and there thrown aloft anew by the pedal.
Throughout all the harmonies one always heard in
great tones a wondrous melody, while once only in the
middle of the piece, besides that chief song, a tenor
voice became prominent in the midst of the chords.
After the Étude, a feeling came over one as of having
seen in a dream a beatific picture which, when half
awake, one would gladly recall.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Vigor, Passion, and Impetus.</h4>
<p>If now the pianist wishes to show by contrast Chopin
in his full vigor, passionate and impetuous, let him
take the great C Minor Étude, the twelfth, <i>Allegro
con fuoco</i>. &ldquo;Great in outline, pride, force and velocity,
it never relaxes its grim grip from the first shrill dissonance
to the overwhelming chordal close,&rdquo; says
Huneker, adding that &ldquo;this end rings out like the crack
of creation.&rdquo; It is supposed to be an expression of the
alternating wrath and despair with which Chopin received
the tidings of the taking of Warsaw by the
Russians in September, 1831, for it was shortly after
this that the Étude was composed. No wonder, to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
quote again from Huneker, that &ldquo;all sweeps along in
tornadic passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pianist hardly can go amiss in making his selection
from the twenty-seven Études, for the contrasts
which he can effect are obvious, and there is among
these compositions not one which has not its special
merits. There is the tenth, of which Von Bülow said
whoever could play it in a really finished manner might
congratulate himself on having climbed to the highest
point of the pianist&rsquo;s Parnassus, and that the whole
repertory of music for the pianoforte does not contain
a study of perpetual motion so full of genius and fancy
as this especial one is universally acknowledged to be,
excepting, possibly, Liszt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Feux Follets.&rdquo; Then there
is number nineteen in C sharp minor, like a nocturne
with the melody in the left hand, with the right hand
answering as a flute would a &rsquo;cello. For contrast take
number twenty-one, the so-called &ldquo;Butterfly Étude&rdquo;&mdash;a
wretched misnomer, because a pianist gifted with
true musical clairvoyance can work up such a gust
of passion in this Étude that any butterfly would be
swept away as if by a hurricane. Nor, in order to
accomplish this, is it necessary to make such a bravura
piece of the Étude as so many pianists ignorantly do.
We have, too, the &ldquo;Winter Wind Étude,&rdquo; in A minor,
Opus 25, number eleven&mdash;the twenty-third in the
collection as usually published&mdash;planned on a grand
scale and carried out in a manner equal to the
plan.</p>
<p>Von Bülow calls attention to the fact that, with all
its sonorousness, &ldquo;the greatest fullness of sound imaginable,&rdquo;
it nowhere trespasses upon the domain of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
the orchestra, but remains pianoforte music in the strictest
sense of the word. &ldquo;To Chopin,&rdquo; says Von
Bülow, in referring to this Étude, &ldquo;is due the honor
and credit of having set fast the boundary between
piano and orchestral music which, through other
composers of the romantic school, especially Robert
Schumann, has been defaced and blotted out, to
the prejudice and damage of both species.&rdquo; While
agreeing with Von Bülow that Chopin was the great
liberator of the pianoforte, I cannot agree with the
exception he takes to the music of Robert Schumann.
If he had referred back to the unpianistic classical
sonata form, he would have been more accurate.</p>
<h4>The Préludes.</h4>
<p>I have gone into some detail regarding these Études
because I regard them, as a whole, among the greatest
of Chopin&rsquo;s works. But I once heard Rubinstein play
the entire set of twenty-four Préludes, and I sometimes
wonder, as one often does with the compositions of a
great genius, whether these Préludes, in spite of their
comparative brevity, should not be ranked as high as
anything Chopin ever wrote. According to tradition,
they were composed during the winter of 1838, which
Chopin spent with George Sand at Majorca in the
Balearic Islands. But there is authority for saying
that they received only the finishing touches there, and
are in fact the gleanings of his portfolios.</p>
<p>It seems as if in these twenty-four pieces every phase
of human emotion were brought out. If my memory
is correct, Rubinstein played them as a solo group at

a Philharmonic concert, or he may have given them
about the same time at one of his recitals. It was in
1872; and while after this long lapse of time it is
impossible to remember every detail of his performance,
I shall never forget the exquisite tenderness with
which he played the very brief Prélude in A major,
the seventh. He simply caressed the keyboard, touched
it as if his fingers were tipped with velvet; and though
into the other compositions of the series he put, according
as their character varied, an immense amount
of passion, or more subdued emotion, I can still hear
this seventh Prélude sounding in my memory, note
for note and bar for bar, as he rendered it&mdash;a prolonged,
tremulous whisper. Schumann regarded the
Préludes as most remarkable, saying that &ldquo;in every
piece we find in his own hand &lsquo;Frédéric Chopin wrote
it.&rsquo; One recognizes him in his pauses, in his quick-coming
breath. He is the boldest, the proudest poet-soul
of his time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each number in the series is complete in itself, a
mood picture; but the series as a whole, in its collection
of moods, its panorama of emotions, represents
the entire range of Chopin&rsquo;s art. The fourth in E
minor, covering only a page, is one of the most pathetic
plaints ever penned. The fifteenth in D flat major, with
its continual reiteration of the dominant, like the incessant
drip of rain on a roof, is a nocturne&mdash;Chopin
in one of his morbid moments; while the eighteenth
in F minor is as bold a piece of dramatic recitative as
though it had been lifted bodily out of a music-drama.
And so we might run the whole range of the collection,
finding each admirable in itself, yet different from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
all the others. What a group for a recital these
twenty-four Préludes make!</p>
<h4>Nocturnes.</h4>
<p>If Chopin had not written the Nocturnes I doubt if
those who play and those who comment on him would
err so often in attributing such an excess of morbidness
to him as they do, or lay the charge of effeminacy
against him. Morbid these Nocturnes undoubtedly
are in many parts, and yet they often rise to the
dignity of elegy, and sometimes even of tragedy. Exquisitely
melodious they are, too, and full of the
haunting mystery of night. The one in C sharp minor,
Opus 27, No. 1, is perhaps the most dramatic of the
series, and Henry T. Finck, in his Chopin essay, is
entirely within bounds when he says that it embodies
a greater variety of emotion and more genuine dramatic
spirit on four pages than many operas on four
hundred. There are greater nocturnes than the one
in G, Opus 37, No. 2, but I must nevertheless regard
it as the most beautiful of all. It may bewitch and
unman the player, as Niecks has said, but, on the
other hand, I think its second melody, like a Venetian
barcarolle breathed through the moonlight, is the
most exquisite thing Chopin ever composed; and note
how, without any undulating accompaniment, its
rhythm nevertheless produces a gentle wavy effect.</p>
<p>Probably the most familiar of all the Nocturnes is
the one in E flat, the second in the first set, Opus 9.
It has been played so much that unless it is interpreted
in a perfect manner it comes perilously near to being
hackneyed; but under the hands of a great pianist, who
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
unites with absolute independence of all his ten fingers,
the soul of a poet, it becomes an iridescent play of
color, with a sombre picture of melancholy seen through
the iridescence. Remenyi played a violin arrangement
of it with such delicacy and so much poetry of
feeling that he actually reconciled one to its transfer
from the pianoforte to the soprano instrument of four
strings.</p>
<h4>Chopin and Poe.</h4>
<p>John Field, an Irish composer (1782-1837), was
the first to compose nocturnes, and it is not unlikely
that Chopin got the pattern from him. Occasionally
at historical recitals one hears a nocturne by John
Field; but I think that if even those who love to question
the originality of great men were familiar with
the nocturnes of Field, they would realize how far
Chopin went beyond him, making out of a small type
an art form of such poetic content that, in spite of
Field having been first in the lists, Chopin may be
said to have originated the form. Naturally, Field did
not relish seeing himself supplanted by this greater
genius, and he said of Chopin that he composed music
for a sick-room, and had &ldquo;a talent of the hospital.&rdquo;
On recital programs Chopin&rsquo;s nocturnes often appear,
and, when played by a master like Paderewski, who
is sensitive to every shade of Chopin&rsquo;s genius, they
are heard with an exquisite feeling of sorrow. In
these Nocturnes, Chopin always seems to me like Edgar
Allan Poe in &ldquo;Ullalume&rdquo; or in &ldquo;Annabel Lee&rdquo;&mdash;and
was not Poe one of the only two American poets of
real genius?</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></div>
<h4>Waltzes and Mazurkas.</h4>
<p>A Chopin waltz will admirably afford contrast in a
group of Chopin pieces on a recital program. Possibly
the waltzes are the most frequently played by
amateurs of all Chopin&rsquo;s compositions. But, to perpetrate
an Irish bull, even those that have been played
to death still are very much alive. It was Schumann
who said that if these waltzes were to be played for
dancing more than half the dancers should be Countesses,
the music is so aristocratic. Indeed, to listen
to these waltzes is like looking at a dance through a
fairy lens. They seem to be improvisations of the
pianist during a dance, and to reflect the thoughts that
arise in the player&rsquo;s mind as he looks on, giving out
the rhythm with the left hand, while the melody and
the ornamental note-groups indicate his fancies&mdash;love,
a jealous plaint, joy, ecstasy, and the tender whispering
of enamored couples as they glide past. The
slow A minor &ldquo;Waltz,&rdquo; with its viola-like left-hand
melody, was Chopin&rsquo;s favorite, and he was so pleased
when Stephen Heller told him that it was his favorite
one, too, that he invited him to luncheon. (Strange
that we always should regard food as the most appropriate
reward of artistic sympathy!) Each waltz, with
the exception of some of the posthumous ones, has its
individual charm, but to me the most beautiful is the
one in C sharp minor, with its infinite expression of
longing in its leading theme and its remarkable chromatic
descent before the brilliant right-hand passage
that follows in the second episode. These chromatics
should be emphasized, as they are a feature of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span>
passage and form gems of harmonization. But few
pianists seem to appreciate their significance and pay
sole attention to bringing out the upper voice.</p>
<p>Thoroughly characteristic of Chopin, thoroughly in
keeping with his Polish nationality and its traditions,
are the Mazurkas&mdash;jewels of music, full of the finest
feeling, the most delicate harmonization, and with a
dash and spirit entirely their own. Weitzmann truly
says that they are the most faithful and animated pictures
of his nation which Chopin has left us, and that
they are masterpieces of their class: &ldquo;Here he stands
forth in his full originality as the head of the romantic
school of music; in them his novel and alluring melodic
and harmonic progressions are even more surprising
than in his larger compositions.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Liszt on the Mazurkas.</h4>
<p>Liszt, too, pauses to pay his tribute to them: &ldquo;Some
portray foolhardy gaiety in the sultry and oppressive
air of a ball, and on the eve of a battle; one hears the
low sighs of parting, whose sobs are stifled by sharp
rhythms of the dance. Others portray the grief of the
sorely anxious soul amid festivities, whose tumult is
unable to drown the profound woe of the heart. Others,
again, show the tears, premonitions and struggles of
a broken heart, devoured by jealousy, sorrowing over
its loss, but repressing the curse. Now we are surrounded
by a swirling frenzy, pierced by an ever-recurring
palpitating melody like the anxious beating of
a loving but rejected heart; and anon distant trumpet
calls resound like dim memories of bygone fame.&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
All this is very fine, although a trifle over-sentimental.
The fact is that the Chopin Mazurkas are archly coquettish,
passionately pleading, full of delicate banter,
love, despair and conquest&mdash;and always thoroughly
original and thoroughly interesting. In fact Chopin
never is commonplace. A Mazurka or two will add
zest to any group of his works on a recital program.</p>
<p>The Polonaises are Chopin&rsquo;s battle-hymns. The
roll of drums, the booming of cannon, the rattle of
musketry and the plaint for the dead&mdash;all these things
one may hear in some of these compositions. The
mourning notes, however, are missing from the &ldquo;A
Major Polonaise,&rdquo; Opus 40, and usually called &ldquo;Le
Militaire.&rdquo; It is not a large canvas, but it is heroic
and one of the most virile of all his works. It was of
this polonaise Chopin said that if he could play it as
it should be played, he would break all the strings of
the pianoforte before he had finished.</p>
<h4>Other Works.</h4>
<p>And then the Ballades and the Scherzos. These are
perhaps Chopin&rsquo;s greatest contributions to the music
of the pianoforte. They are wonderfully original,
wonderfully emotional, yet never to the point of morbidness,
full of his original harmonies, fascinating
rhythms and glow. In the Scherzos he is not gaily
abandoned, as the title would suggest, but often grim
and mocking&mdash;tragedy mocking itself.</p>
<p>Chopin also wrote Sonatas&mdash;felt himself obliged to,
perhaps, because he was writing for the pianoforte, because
pianoforte music still was in the grip of the thirty-two
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
Beethoven pianoforte sonatas. By no means did
he adhere to the classical form; yet these three sonatas
are not to be counted among his most successful compositions.
One of them, the B flat minor, contains the
familiar funeral march which has been said to &ldquo;give
forth the pain and grief of an entire nation&rdquo;&mdash;Chopin&rsquo;s
nation, sorrowing Poland; and, indeed, the middle episode,
the trio of the march, is pathetic to the verge of
tears, while in the other portions the march progresses
to the grave amid the tolling of bells and the heavy
tramp of soldiery. It is played and played, possibly
played too much; and yet, when well played, never
misses leaving a deep impression. Because people will
persist in &ldquo;playing&rdquo; certain popular pieces, there is no
reason these should not be enjoyed when interpreted
by a master. There is a vast difference between interpretation
and mere &ldquo;playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This funeral march is followed in the sonata by
a finale which aptly enough has been described as
night winds sweeping over graves. The funeral march
often is played at recitals as a detached piece. I cannot
see why pianists do not add this finale, which has real
psychological connection with it. The &ldquo;Berceuse,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Barcarolle,&rdquo; two &ldquo;Concertos for Piano and Orchestra,&rdquo;
which often are slightingly spoken of, and most
unjustly, since they are full of beautiful melody and
most grateful to play&mdash;beyond these it does not seem
necessary to go here, unless, perhaps, to mention the
Impromptus, which are full of the most delightful
<i>chiaroscuro</i>, and the great F minor &ldquo;Fantaisie.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></div>
<h4>A Noble from Head to Foot.</h4>
<p>Because Chopin wrote only for the pianoforte, because
as a rule his pieces are not long, his greatness
was not at first recognized. The conservatives seemed
to think no man could be great unless he wrote sonatas
in four movements for the piano and symphonies for the
orchestra, unless he composed for fifty or sixty instruments
instead of for only one. But although Jumbo
was large, he was not accounted beautiful, and worship
of the big is a mistaken kind of reverence. Chopin&rsquo;s
briefest mazurka is worth infinitely more than many
sonatas that cover many pages. This composer was
a tone poet of the highest order. While to-day we
regard him mainly as the interpreter of beauty, in his
own day he was an innovator, a reformer and, like his
own Poles, a revolutionist. The pianoforte&mdash;the pianoforte
as a solo instrument&mdash;sufficed for his most beautiful
dreams, for his most passionate longings. Bie,
in his &ldquo;History of the Pianoforte and Pianoforte Players,&rdquo;
tells us that Chopin smiled when he heard that
Czerny had composed another overture for eight pianos
and sixteen persons, and was very happy over it.
&ldquo;Chopin,&rdquo; adds Bie, &ldquo;opened to the two hands a wider
world than Czerny could give to thirty-two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rubinstein, as quoted by Huneker, apostrophizes him
as &ldquo;the piano bard, the piano rhapsodist, the piano
mind, the piano soul.... Tragic, romantic,
virile, heroic, dramatic, fantastic, soulful, sweet,
dreamy, brilliant, grand, simple&mdash;all possible expressions
are found in his compositions and all are
sung by him upon his instrument.&rdquo; Huneker himself
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
says: &ldquo;In Chopin&rsquo;s music there are many pianists,
many styles, and all are correct if they are poetically
musical, logical and individually sincere.&rdquo; Best of all,
he enlarged the scope for individual expression in
music. Once for all, he got pianoforte music away
from the set form of the classical sonata. &ldquo;He was
sincere, and his survival when nearly all of Mendelssohn,
much of Schumann, and half of Berlioz have
suffered an eclipse, is proof positive of his vitality.&rdquo;&mdash;Thus
again Huneker. Bie says, in summing up his
position, that his greatness is his aristocracy; that &ldquo;he
stands among musicians, in his faultless vesture, a
noble from head to foot.&rdquo; But, above all, he is a searcher
of the human soul, and, because he searched it out on
the pianoforte, is he therefore less great than if he had
drawn it out on the strings, piped it on the reeds, blown
it through the tubes and battered it on the drumheads
of the orchestra?</p>

<h2>VI</h2>
<h3>SCHUMANN, THE &ldquo;INTIMATE&rdquo;</h3>
</div>
<p>Having finished with his Chopin group, the
pianist is apt to follow it with his Schumann
selections, and we meet with another original
musical genius. Robert Schumann was born at
Zwickau in June, 1810. His father was a book publisher
and was in hopes that the son would show literary
aptitude. In fact, the elder Schumann discouraged
Robert&rsquo;s musical aspirations; and as a result, instead
of receiving early in life a systematic musical
training, his education was along other lines. He
studied law at Leipzig in 1828 and in Heidelberg in
1829, and was thus what is rare among musicians&mdash;a
composer with an academic education.</p>
<p>His meeting with the celebrated pianoforte teacher,
Frederick Wieck, the Leschetitzki of his day, determined
Schumann to enter upon a musical career. Wieck took
him into his home in Leipzig and he studied the pianoforte
with a view of becoming a virtuoso. In order
to gain greater freedom in fingering, he devised a
mechanical apparatus by which one finger was suspended
in a sling while the others played upon the keyboard.
Unfortunately, through the use of this contrivance
he strained the tendons of one hand and his
dream of a virtuoso&rsquo;s career vanished. Meanwhile he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
had fallen in love with his teacher&rsquo;s daughter, Clara
Wieck, and finally, after determined opposition on the
part of her father, married her in 1840. Later in life
a brain trouble from which he had suffered intermittently
became more severe, and in February, 1854, he
became possessed of the idea that Schubert&rsquo;s spirit had
appeared to him and given him a theme to work out.
He abruptly left the room in which he was sitting with
some friends in his house at Düsseldorf and threw himself
into the Rhine. Some boatmen rescued him from
drowning, but he had to be taken to an asylum near
Bonn, where he died in July, 1856.</p>
<p>These circumstances in his life are mentioned here
not only because of their interest, but because they
explain some aspects of his music. Schumann was
of a brooding disposition, intensely introspective. Compared
with Chopin, his music lacks iridescence and
shows a want of brilliancy. This will be immediately
apparent if at a recital a pianist places the Schumann
pieces after a Chopin group, as he is apt to do for the
sake of the very contrast which they afford. But if
Schumann&rsquo;s compositions are wanting in superficially
attractive brightness, they more than make up for it in
their profounder characteristics. All through them
one seems to hear a deep-sounding tone. One might
say that his works for the keyboard instrument are
pianoforte music for the viola, and for that reason they
appear to me so expressive and so appealing. The
harmonies are wonderfully compact. One feels after
striking a Schumann chord like stiffening the fingers
in order to hold it down more firmly, keep a grip on
it, and let it sound to its last echo.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span></div>
<h4>Poet, Bourgeois, and Philosopher.</h4>
<p>In Schumann&rsquo;s music the sensitive listener will find
a curious blending of poet, bourgeois, and philosopher.
He had the higher fancy, the warmth of the poet, a
bourgeois love of what was intimate and homely, and
the introspection of the philosopher. Sometimes he is
so introspective that he appears to me actually to be
burrowing in harmony like a mole. The melodies are
interwoven; sometimes the upper voice flutters lightly
down upon &ldquo;contrapuntal collisions in the bass&rdquo;; frequently
his rhythms are syncopated; melodies are
superimposed upon each other; he uses &ldquo;imitations,&rdquo;
canonic figuration, and often by introducing a single
note foreign to the scale, suddenly lowers or lifts an
entire passage. There are interior voices in his music,
half suppressed, yet making themselves heard now and
then above the principal melody. He loves &ldquo;anticipations&rdquo;&mdash;advancing
a single note or a few notes of the
harmony and then filling in the sustained tone or tones
with what was at first lacking. These characteristics
are so marked that it is as easy to recognize Schumann
as it is to distinguish Chopin in the first few bars of a
work by either. Each is <i>sui generis</i>, each has his own
hallmark, and it is a great thing in music, as in other
arts, to have one&rsquo;s product so personal that there can
be no mistaking whose it is.</p>
<p>Schumann made valuable contributions to so-called
program music. His pieces, besides intrinsic musical
worth, have a distinct meaning, usually indicated by the
titles he gives them. And these titles themselves often
are suggested by the works of authors whom he admired,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
or hark back to certain fanciful figures like
harlequins and columbines. His second work for the
pianoforte, &ldquo;The Papillons,&rdquo; derived its inspiration
from the poet, Jean Paul, who was at that time an
object of his intense worship. But whoever expects
to find butterflies fluttering through these Schumann
pieces will be mistaken. They are rather symbols of
thoughts still in the chrysalis state and waiting, like
butterflies, to cast off the shell and gain air and freedom.
This symbolism must be borne in mind in listening
to &ldquo;The Papillons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Schumann himself said, in a general way, regarding
his programmatic intentions in this and other works,
that the titles given to his music should be taken very
much like the titles of poems, and that, as in the case
of poems, the music in itself should be beautiful, irrespective
of title or printed explanation. This is true of
all program music that has survived. It will be found
beautiful in itself; but it also is easy to discover that the
titles and explanations which are calculated to place
the hearer in certain receptive moods vastly add to his
enjoyment.</p>
<h4>&ldquo;Carnaval&rdquo; and &ldquo;Kreisleriana.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>I am always glad when a pianist elects to place the
Schumann &ldquo;Carnaval&rdquo; on his program, because it is so
characteristic of the composer&rsquo;s method of work and of
his writing short pieces <i>en suite</i>, giving a separate name
to each of his diversions yet uniting them into one
composition by means of a comprehensive title. The
complete title to this work is &ldquo;Carnaval Scènes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
Mignonnes sur Quatre Notes pour Piano, Op. 9.&rdquo; The
four notes are A S C H, and in explanation it should
be said that in German S (es) is E flat, and H the
B of our musical scale. Asch was the birthplace of
Ernestine von Fricken, one of Schumann&rsquo;s early loves.
Three of the divisions of the &ldquo;Carnaval&rdquo; are entitled
Florestan, Eusebius, and March of the Davidsbündler.
Schumann had founded the &ldquo;Neue Zeitschrift für
Musik,&rdquo; and he contributed to it under the noms-de-plume
of Florestan, Eusebius and Raro; while his
associates were denominated the Davidsbündler, it being
their mission to combat and put to flight the old
fogies of music, as David had the Philistines. Schumann
himself is the looker-on at this carnival, a
thinker wandering through the gay whirl, drawing his
own conclusions, and noting down in music the varied
figures as they pass, and his reflections on them. We
meet Chopin and Paganini, each neatly characterized;
Chiarina (the Italian diminutive of Clara) and Estrella
(none other than Ernestine herself); also Harlequin,
Pantalon, and Columbine. The Davidsbündler
march in to the strains of the German folk-song,</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Grandfather wedded my grandmother dear,<br />
So grandfather then was a bridegroom, I fear,&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>and the whole ends in a merry uproar. He wrote another
carnival suite, Opus 26, the &ldquo;Faschingschwank
aus Wien,&rdquo; in which he introduced a suggestion of
the &ldquo;Marseillaise,&rdquo; which was at that time forbidden
to be played in Vienna.</p>
<p>The title of another work which ranks among his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
finest productions, the &ldquo;Kreisleriana,&rdquo; also requires explanation.
This he derived from a book by E. T. A.
Hoffmann, who sometimes is spoken of as the German
Poe, although he lacks the exquisite art of the American
author&mdash;in fact, is a Poe bound up in much heavy
German philosophy and turgid introspection. The
<i>Kreisler</i> of Hoffmann&rsquo;s book is an exuberant sentimentalist,
and is said to have had his prototype in Kapellmeister
Ludwig Böhner, who, after a brilliant early
career, had become addicted to drink and was reduced
to maudlin memories of his former triumphs. In
Hoffmann&rsquo;s book there is a contrast drawn between
this pathetic character, whose ideals have become
shadows which he vainly chases, and the prosaic views
of life as set forth by another character <i>Kater Murr</i>
(literally <i>Tomcat Purr</i>). But these &ldquo;Kreisleriana,&rdquo; of
which Bie says &ldquo;the joys and sorrows expressed in
these pieces were never put into form with more sovereign
power,&rdquo; should be entitled &ldquo;Schumanniana,&rdquo; for
although the title is derived from Hoffmann, the content
is Schumann.</p>
<h4>Thoughts of His Clara.</h4>
<p>Concerning the work as a whole he wrote to Clara
while in the throes of composition: &ldquo;This music now
in me, and always such beautiful melodies! Think of
it, since my last letter to you I have another entire book
of new things ready. I intend to call them &lsquo;Kreisleriana,&rsquo;
and in them you and a thought of you play
the chief rôle, and I shall dedicate them to you. Yes,
they belong to you as to no one else, and how sweetly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
you will smile when you find yourself in them! My music
seems to me so wonderfully interwoven, in spite of
all its simplicity, and speaking right from the heart. It
has that effect upon all for whom I play these things,
as I now do gladly and often.&rdquo; If Clara and a thought
of Clara play the chief rôle, what becomes of <i>Kreisler</i>
and <i>Kater Murr</i>? Surely &ldquo;Kreisleriana&rdquo; are Schumanniana.</p>
<p>Full of varied characteristics are the &ldquo;Fantasie
Pieces.&rdquo; Among these is the familiar &ldquo;Warum,&rdquo; which
one has but to hear to recognize at once that it is no
ordinary Why, but a question upon the answer to which
depends the happiness of a lifetime; &ldquo;At Evening&rdquo;
(<i>Abends</i>), with its sense of perfect peace; the buoyant
&ldquo;Soaring&rdquo; (<i>Aufschwung</i>); &ldquo;Whims&rdquo; (<i>Grillen</i>);
&ldquo;Night Scene,&rdquo; an echo of the legend of Hero and
Leander; the fable, &ldquo;Dream-Whirls&rdquo; (<i>Traumeswirren</i>)
and the &ldquo;End of the Song,&rdquo; with its mingling of
humor and sadness. These &ldquo;Fantasie Pieces&rdquo; and the
aptly named &ldquo;Novelettes&rdquo; seem destined always to retain
their popularity. And then there are the &ldquo;Scenes
from Childhood,&rdquo; to which belongs the <a name='TC_2'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Traümerei'">&ldquo;Träumerei&rdquo;</ins>;
the &ldquo;Forest Scenes,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sonatas;&rdquo; the heroic technical
studies, based on the Paganini &ldquo;Capriccios,&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;Études Symphoniques,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Fantasie,&rdquo; above
the first movement of which he placed these lines from
Schlegel:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;Through every tone there passes,<br />
To him who deigns to list,<br />
In varied earthly dreaming,<br />
<span class='indent2'>&nbsp;</span>A tone of gentleness.&rdquo;</p>
</td></tr></table>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span></div>
<p>Clara was the &ldquo;tone,&rdquo; as he told her. It was largely
through Madame Schumann&rsquo;s public playing of her
husband&rsquo;s works that they won their way. Even so,
owing to their lack of brilliancy and their introspection,
they were long in coming to their own. But the best
of them, including, of course, the admirable &ldquo;A Minor
Concerto,&rdquo; long will retain their hold on the modern
pianist&rsquo;s repertoire. William Mason went to Leipzig
in 1849. &ldquo;Only a few years before I arrived at Leipzig,&rdquo;
he says in his &ldquo;Memories,&rdquo; &ldquo;Schumann&rsquo;s genius
was so little appreciated that when he entered the store
of Breitkopf &amp; Härtel with a new manuscript under
his arm, the clerks would nudge one another and laugh.
One of them told me that they regarded him as a
crank and a failure because his pieces remained on
the shelf and were in the way. * * * Shortly
after my return from Germany (to New York) I went
to Breusing&rsquo;s, then one of the principal music stores
in the city,&mdash;the Schirmers are his successors,&mdash;and
asking for certain compositions by Schumann, I was
informed that they had his music in stock, but as
there was no demand for it, it was packed away in a
bundle, and kept in the basement.&rdquo; What a contrast

<h3>LISZT, THE GIANT AMONG VIRTUOSOS</h3>
</div>
<p>It is possible, but not likely, that some pianist willing,
for the moment at least, to sacrifice outward
success to inward satisfaction, will, after he has
played the Schumann selections on his program, essay
one of Brahms&rsquo;s shorter pianoforte compositions.
These are even more introspective than Schumann&rsquo;s
works and combine a wealth of learning with great
depth of musical feeling. It is almost necessary, however,
that one should know them thoroughly in order
to appreciate them, and audiences have been so slow
to welcome them that they appear but infrequently on
recital programs. Those of my readers, however, who
are pianists yet still unacquainted with these rare and
beautiful compositions, will soon find themselves under
the spell of their intimate personal expression if they
will get them and start to learn them. The Brahms
Variations on a theme by Händel make a stupendous
work, and the rare occasions on which it is played by
any one capable of mastering it should be regarded as
&ldquo;events.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grieg, with his clear, fascinating Norwegian
clang-tints, which also play through his fascinating
&ldquo;Concerta&rdquo; in A minor; Dvorak, the Bohemian;
Tschaikowsky, whose first &ldquo;Concerto&rdquo; in B flat minor
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
is among the finest modern works of its kind; or some
of the neo-Russians, are composers who may figure
on the program of a modern pianoforte recital. But it
is more likely that the virtuoso will here elect to bring
his recital to a close with some work by the grandest
figure in the history of pianoforte playing and one of
the greatest in the history of composition&mdash;Franz
Liszt.</p>
<h4>Kissed by Beethoven.</h4>
<p>Liszt was born at Raiding, near Odenburg in Hungary,
in October, 1811, and he died in Bayreuth in
July, 1886. From early boyhood, when he was a
pianoforte prodigy, almost until his death, he occupied
a unique position in the musical world. He was the
Paganini of the pianoforte, the greatest pianist that
ever lived, and he was a great composer; and although,
as a virtuoso, he retired from public performances long
before he died, his fame as a player and his still greater
fame as a composer have not diminished and his influence
still is potent.</p>
<p>His father was an amateur, and began giving him
instruction when he was six years old. The boy&rsquo;s talent
was so pronounced that even without professional instruction
he was able, when he was nine years old, to
appear in public and play a difficult concerto by Ries.
So great was his success that his father arranged for
other concerts at Pressburg. After the second of these,
several Hungarian noblemen agreed to provide an annual
stipend of 600 florins for six years for Franz&rsquo;s
further musical education. The family then removed
to Vienna, where, for about a year and a half, the boy
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span>
took pianoforte lessons from Czerny and theory with
Salieri. Beethoven heard of him, and asked to see
him, and at their meeting, after Franz had played, without
notes and without the other instruments, Beethoven&rsquo;s
pianoforte trio, Op. 97 (the large one in B
flat major), the great master embraced and kissed him.
In 1823 he was taken to Paris with a view to being
placed in the Conservatoire. But although he passed
his examination without difficulty, Cherubini, at that
time the director of the institution and prejudiced
against infant phenomena, revived a rule excluding foreigners
and admission was denied him.</p>
<p>His success as a pianist, however, was enormous and
there was the greatest demand in salons and musical
circles for &ldquo;le petit Litz.&rdquo; (As some writer, whose
name I cannot recall, has said, &ldquo;the nearest Paris came
to appreciating Liszt was to call him &lsquo;Litz.&rsquo;&rdquo;) He was
the friend of Chopin, of other musicians, and of painters
and literary men, and the doors of the most exclusive
drawing-rooms of the French capital were open
to him. Paganini played in Paris in 1831, and his
wonderful feats of technique inspired Liszt to efforts
to develop the technique of the pianoforte with as much
daring as Paganini had shown in developing the
capacity of the violin. This was the beginning of those
wonderful feats of virtuosity as well as of the remarkable
technical demands made in his compositions, both
of which combined have done so much to make the
pianoforte what it is, and to bring out its full potentiality
as regards execution and expression.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></div>
<h4>Episode with Countess D&rsquo;Agoult.</h4>
<p>For a time Liszt left Paris with the Countess
d&rsquo;Agoult, who wrote under the nom-de-plume of
Daniel Stern, and who was the mother of his three
children, of whom Cosima became the wife, first of
Von Bülow and then of Wagner. His four years with
the Countess he passed in Geneva. Twice, however, he
came forth from this retirement to cross the sword of
virtuosity with and vanquish his only serious rival in
pianoforte playing, Sigismund Thalberg, a brilliant
player and a man, like Liszt himself, of fascinating personality,
but lacking the Hungarian&rsquo;s intellectual capacity.
In 1829, he and Countess d&rsquo;Agoult having separated,
he began his triumphal progress through Europe,
and for the following ten years the world rang with his
fame. He then settled down as Court Conductor at
Weimar, which became the headquarters of the new
romantic movement in Germany. Hardly a person
of distinction in music or any of the other arts passed
through the town without a visit to the Altenburg, to
pay his respects to Liszt. At Weimar, &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; had
its first performance; here Berlioz&rsquo;s works found a hearing;
here everything new in music that also was meritorious
was made welcome. Liszt&rsquo;s activity at Weimar
continued until 1859, when he left there on account of
the hostility displayed to the production of Cornelius&rsquo;s
opera, &ldquo;The Barber of Bagdad,&rdquo; and its resultant failure.
He remained away from Weimar for eleven
years, living for the most part in Rome, until 1870,
when he was invited to conduct the Beethoven festival
and re-established cordial relations with the Court.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
Thereafter he divided his year between Rome, Buda-Pest,
where he had been made President of the new
Hungarian Academy of Music, and Weimar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Liszt, the artist and the man,&rdquo; says Baker, in his
&ldquo;Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,&rdquo; &ldquo;is one of
the grand figures in the history of music. Generous,
kindly and liberal-minded, whole-souled in his devotion
to art, superbly equipped as an interpreter of classic
and romantic works alike, a composer of original conceptions
and daring execution, a conductor of marvellous
insight, worshipped as teacher and friend by a
host of disciples, reverenced and admired by his fellow-musicians,
honored by institutions of learning and
by potentates as no artist before or since, his influence,
spread by those whom he personally taught and swayed,
will probably increase rather than diminish as time goes
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has been said that Liszt passed through six lives
in the course of his existence&mdash;only three less than a
cat. As &ldquo;petit Litz&rdquo; he was the precocious child adored
of Paris; as a youth, he plunged into the early romanticism
which united the devotees of various branches
of art in the French capital: next came the episode
with the Countess d&rsquo;Agoult; then his triumphal tours
through Europe; settling at Weimar, he became the
centre of the modern musical movement in Europe;
finally, he revolved in a cycle through Rome, Buda-Pest
and Weimar, followed from place to place by a band
of devotees.</p>
<p>Liszt&rsquo;s compositions for the pianoforte may be classified
as follows: &ldquo;Fantasies Dramatiques&rdquo;; &ldquo;Années de
Pèlerinage&rdquo;; &ldquo;Harmonies Poetiques et Religieuses&rdquo;;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
the Sonata, Concertos, Études, and miscellaneous
works; &ldquo;Rhapsodies Hongroises&rdquo;; arrangements and
transcriptions from Berlioz, Beethoven, Weber, Paganini,
Schubert and others.</p>
<h4>The Don Juan Fantasie.</h4>
<p>Among the &ldquo;Fantasies Dramatiques,&rdquo; which are
variations on themes from operas, not mere potpourris
or transcriptions, but genuine fantasies, and usually
based on one or two themes only, the best known is
the &ldquo;Don Juan Fantasie.&rdquo; It is founded upon the duet,
&ldquo;La ci darem la mano.&rdquo; Liszt utilizes a passage from
the overture as an introduction, then gives the entire
duet, varying it, however, not in set form, but with the
effect of a brilliant fantasia, and then winds up the
whole with a presto on the &ldquo;Champagne Song.&rdquo; It
is true it no longer is Mozart&mdash;but Mozart might be
glad if it were. It is even possible that the time will
come when &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; will have vanished from
the operatic stage, yet be remembered by this brilliant
fantasia of Liszt&rsquo;s. It is one of the great <i>tours de
force</i> of pianoforte music, and it is good music as well.
Another of the better known &ldquo;Fantasies Dramatiques&rdquo;
is the one Liszt made from &ldquo;Norma,&rdquo; in which occurs
a long sustained trill and a melody for the right hand,
while the left plays another melody and the accompaniment
to the whole. In other words, there is in this
passage a trill sustained throughout, two melodies and
the accompaniment, all going on at the same time, yet
written with such perfect knowledge of pianoforte technique
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span>
that any virtuoso worthy of the name as used in
a modern sense, can compass it.</p>
<p>A work called the &ldquo;Hexameron&rdquo; is included in catalogues
of Liszt&rsquo;s compositions, although he only contributed
part of it. It is the march from Bellini&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Puritani&rdquo; with six variations, written by six pianists
and originally played by them on six pianofortes, five
of them full grands, while Chopin, whose variation
was not of the bravura, kind, sat at a two-stringed semi-grand.
Liszt contributed the introduction, the connecting
links and the finale of the &ldquo;Hexameron.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Années de Pèlerinage&rdquo; were published in three
divisions, extending in point of time from 1835 to
1883. They are a series of musical impressions, as the
titles indicate&mdash;&ldquo;Au lac de Wallenstadt, Pastoral,&rdquo; &ldquo;Au
bord d&rsquo;une source, Sposalizio&rdquo; (after Raphael&rsquo;s picture
in the Brera), &ldquo;Il Penseroso&rdquo; (after Michael Angelo).
Many of these are adroit and elegant in the treatment
of the pianoforte, and at the same time beautiful as
music. The &ldquo;Harmonies&rdquo; are partly transcriptions of
his own vocal pieces, partly musical illustrations to
poems. Among them is the familiar &ldquo;Cantique
d&rsquo;Amour,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Benediction de Dieu dans la solitude,&rdquo;
of which he himself was very fond. William
Mason says that at the Altenburg a copy of it always
was lying on the pianoforte, &ldquo;which Liszt had used
so many times when playing for his guests that it became
associated with memories of Berlioz, Rubinstein,
Vieuxtemps, Wieniawski, Joachim.&rdquo; When Mr. Mason
left Weimar he took this copy with him as a
souvenir, still has it, and treasures it all the more
for the marks of usage which it bears. The &ldquo;Consolations,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
which, as Edward Dannreuther says, may be
taken as corollaries to the &ldquo;Harmonies,&rdquo; are tenderly
expressive pianoforte pieces.</p>
<h4>Giant Strides in Virtuosity.</h4>
<p>The Études bear the dates 1827, 1839 and 1852, and
as they are in the main progressive editions of the
same pieces, they represent the history of pianoforte
technique as it developed under Liszt&rsquo;s own fingers.
In their earliest shape when issued in 1827, they were
but little different from the classical Études of Czerny
and Cramer. In their latest shape they form the extreme
of virtuosity. Indeed, these three editions are
three giant strides in the development of pianoforte
technique. Von Bülow&rsquo;s coupling of the Étude called
&ldquo;Feux Follets&rdquo; with the A flat study (No. 10) of
Chopin already has been quoted under that composer.
He considered it even more difficult. Schumann called
the collection &ldquo;Sturm und Graus Etuden&rdquo; (Studies of
Storm and Dread), and expressed the opinion that there
were only ten or twelve pianists living who could play
them. In the Étude called &ldquo;Waldesrauschen&rdquo; will be
found some ingenious double counterpoint. The theme
is divided into two portions, a descending and ascending
one, which later on appear together, with first one
and then the other uppermost. Other titles among the
Études are &ldquo;Paysage,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mazeppa&rdquo; (a tremendous test
of endurance), &ldquo;Vision,&rdquo; &ldquo;Chasse-neige,&rdquo; &ldquo;Harmonies
de Soir&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gnomentanz.&rdquo; Through Liszt&rsquo;s transcriptions
of some of the Paganini pieces in the form of
Études, which include the famous &ldquo;Bell Rondo&rdquo; from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
one of the Paganini concertos, this piece, for example,
now is far better known as a pianoforte composition
than in its original form for violin.</p>
<h4>Sonata, Concertos and Rhapsodies.</h4>
<p>The &ldquo;Sonata in B Minor&rdquo; dedicated to Schumann is
one of the few sonatas in which there is psychological
unity throughout. This is due to the fact that it is
one movement; although by employing various themes
both in rapid and in slow time, Liszt has given it a certain
aspect of division into movements. It might well
serve as a model to younger composers who think they
have to write sonatas. Dannreuther, it is true, says
of it that it is &ldquo;a curious compound of true genius and
empty rhetoric,&rdquo; but admits that it contains enough of
genuine impulse and originality in the themes of the
opening section, and of suave calm in the melody of
the section that stands for the slow movement, to secure
the hearer&rsquo;s attention. Mr. Hanchett&rsquo;s characterization
of it as one of the most masterly compositions
ever put into this form&mdash;a gigantic, wholly admirable
and original work&mdash;is more just.</p>
<p>The two pianoforte concertos (in E flat and A
major) are superb works. Not only are they written
with all the skill which Liszt knew so well how to
apply when composing for the instrument, but with this
technical perfection they also unite thought and feeling.
Like the sonata, they show throughout their development
the psychological unity which is so essentially
modern. What the pianoforte owes to Chopin
and Liszt can be summed up by saying that they were
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
poets and thinkers who took the trouble to thoroughly
understand the instrument. Because their music sounds
so well on it, at least one of them, Liszt, frequently is
stigmatized as a trickster of virtuosity and a charlatan,
as if there were some wonderful mark of genius in
writing something for one instrument that sounds better
on another or may not sound as well as it ought
to on any. If Liszt&rsquo;s pianoforte music is grateful to
the player and equally grateful to the listener, it is
not only because he knew how to write for the pianoforte,
but because, with deep thoughts and poetic feelings,
he also understood how to express them clearly
and pianistically.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Rhapsodies Hongroises&rdquo; are of such dazzling
brilliancy and show off a pianist&rsquo;s technique to such
good purpose and so brilliantly, that their real musical
worth has been under-estimated. They are full of
splendid fire, vitality and passion, and their rhythmic
throb is simply irresistible. Like the Études, their
history is curious. At first they were merely short
transcriptions of Hungarian tunes. These were elaborated
and republished and canceled, and then rewritten
and published again. In all there are fifteen pieces in
the set, ending with the &ldquo;Rakoczy March.&rdquo; As &ldquo;Ungarische
Melodien&rdquo; they began to appear in 1838; as
&ldquo;Melodies Hongroises&rdquo; in 1846; as &ldquo;Rhapsodies Hongroises&rdquo;
in 1854. Consider that they are over fifty
years old, yet remain the greatest pieces for the display
of brilliant technique and the most grateful works for
which a pianist can ask, and that at the same time
they are full of admirable musical content! Because
they happen to be brilliant and effective they are called
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
trashy, whereas they owe their brilliancy and effectiveness
to Liszt&rsquo;s own transcendent virtuosity, to his
knowledge of the pianoforte. In order to be great
must music be &ldquo;classic,&rdquo; heavy and dull, and badly written
for the instrument on which it is to be played?</p>
<h4>How Liszt Played.</h4>
<p>In those charming reminiscences from which I already
have had occasion to quote several times, William
Mason&rsquo;s &ldquo;Memories of a Musical Life,&rdquo; Mr. Mason
says that time and again at Weimar he heard Liszt
play, and that there is absolutely no doubt in his mind
that Liszt was the greatest pianist of the nineteenth
century, what the Germans call an <i>Erscheinung</i>, an
epoch-making genius. Tausig said of him: &ldquo;Liszt
dwells alone upon a solitary mountain-top and none of
us can approach him.&rdquo; Rubinstein said to Mr. William
Steinway, in the year 1873 (I quote from Mason):
&ldquo;Put all the rest of us together and we would not make
one Liszt.&rdquo; While Mr. Mason willingly acknowledges
that there have been other great pianists, some of them
now living, he adds: &ldquo;But I must dissent from those
writers who affirm that any of these can be placed upon
a level with Liszt. Those who make this assertion are
too young to have heard Liszt other than in his declining
years, and it is unjust to compare the playing
of one who has long since passed his prime with that
of one who is still in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Edward Dannreuther, who heard Liszt play from
1863 onward, says that there was about his playing an
air of improvisation and the expression of a grand and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
fine personality, perfect self-possession, grace, dignity
and never-failing fire; that his tone was large and penetrating,
but not hard, every effect being produced naturally
and easily. Dannreuther adds that he has heard
performances, it may be of the same pieces, by younger
men, such as Rubinstein and Tausig, but that they left
an impression as of Liszt at second-hand or of Liszt
past his prime. &ldquo;None of his contemporaries or pupils
were so spontaneous, individual and convincing in their
playing; and none except Tausig so infallible with their
fingers and wrists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Liszt himself paid this superb tribute to the pianoforte
as an instrument: &ldquo;To me my pianoforte is what
to the seaman is his boat, to the Arab his horse; nay,
more, it has been till now my eye, my speech, my life.
Its strings have vibrated under my passions and its
yielding keys have obeyed my every caprice. It may
be that the secret tie which binds me to it so closely
is a delusion, but I hold the pianoforte very high. In
my view, it takes the first place in the hierarchy of
instruments. It is the oftenest used and the widest
spread. In the circumference of its seven octaves it
embraces the whole range of an orchestra, and a man&rsquo;s
ten fingers are enough to render the harmonies which
in an orchestra are brought out only by the combination
of hundreds of musicians. The pianoforte has on
the one side the capacity of assimilation, the capacity
of taking unto itself the life of all instruments; on
the other hand it has its own life, its own growth, its
own individual development. My highest ambition is
to leave to the piano players to come after me, some
useful instructions, the footprints of advanced attainment,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
something which may some day provide a worthy
witness of the labor and study of my youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bear in mind that Liszt played for Beethoven, that
he was a contemporary of Chopin and Schumann, that
he was one of the first to throw himself heart and soul
into the Wagner movement, and that death came to
him while he was attending the festival performances
at Bayreuth; bear in mind, I repeat, that he played for
Beethoven and died at &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo;; strive to appreciate
the extremes of musical history and development implied
by this; then remember that he remains a potent
force in music&mdash;and you may be able to form some idea
of his greatness.</p>

<h2>VIII</h2>
<h3>WITH PADEREWSKI&mdash;A MODERN PIANIST ON TOUR</h3>
</div>
<p>Liszt never was in this country, but we can gain
some idea of the success that would have been
his from the triumphs of Ignace Paderewski.
Other famous pianists have come to this country&mdash;Thalberg
in 1856; Rubinstein in 1872; Von Bülow,
Joseffy, who took up his residence here; Rosenthal,
Josef Hofmann. But Paderewski&rsquo;s success has been
greater than any of these. Americans are said to be
fickle; but although Paderewski no longer is a novelty,
his name still is the one with which to fill a concert
hall from floor to roof.</p>
<p>Why this is so is no secret. Hear him and you will
understand the reason. To a technique which does not
hesitate at anything and an industry that flinches at
nothing&mdash;no one practices more assiduously than he&mdash;he
adds the soul of a poet and the strength of an athlete.
He looks slender and poetical enough as he sits
at the piano on the concert stage; but if you watch
him from near by you will be able to note the great
physical power which he can bring into play when necessary&mdash;<em>and
which he never brings into play unless it
is necessary</em>. Therefore he combines poetry with force;
and back of both is thought&mdash;intellectual capacity.</p>
<p>In a frame on the wall of a New York trust company
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span>
is a check for $171,981.89. It represents the net receipts
of one virtuoso for one concert tour, and is believed
to be the largest actual amount ever earned in
this country by an artist, whether singer or player, in
a single season. This check is drawn to the order of
Ignace J. Paderewski.</p>
<p>An opinion regarding the piano by a man who by
playing it can earn so large a sum, and earn it because
he is the greatest living exponent of pianoforte playing,
would seem worth having. Paderewski believes
that, save in one respect, the pianoforte has reached
perfection and is incapable of further improvement. He
does not think that anything more should be done
to add to its volume of tone. If anything, he considers
this too great and the instrument too loud already. Instead
of more power, rather less would be satisfactory.
Wherein, however, he considers the instrument still
lacking, notwithstanding its wonderful development
during the last century, is in its capacity for sustained
tone&mdash;for holding a long-drawn-out tone with the facility
of the violin, for example. He is convinced, however,
that the means of imparting this capacity for sustaining
tone to the pianoforte will be discovered in due
time and that the invention probably will be made in
this country. That increased tone-sustaining power
for the instrument is a great desideratum doubtless is
the opinion of many experts; but that the greatest master
of the pianoforte considers it perfect in other respects
is highly interesting and significant. After all,
it remains the greatest of all solo instruments, because,
within the smallest compass and with the simplest
means of control, it has the range of an orchestra. For
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
this reason it is the most popular of instruments and,
in its manufacture, extends from the polished dry-goods
box with internal organs of iron, wire and felt
and with a glistening row of celluloid teeth ready to
bite as soon as ever the lid is raised, to the highest-class
concert grand.</p>
<h4>The &ldquo;Piano Doctor.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>We who have our pianofortes in our own homes and
are content with an occasional visit from the tuner, little
dream of the care bestowed upon the instrument on
which an artist like Paderewski plays. Instrument? I
should have said instruments; for, when he is on tour,
he has a whole suite of them, no less than four, and
each is coddled as if it were a prima donna fresh from
the hands of Madame Marchesi, instead of a thing of
wood, metal and ivory. True, these pianos do not
have their throats sprayed on the slightest possible occasion,
but they are carefully protected against extremes
of heat and cold, and, while the prima donna consults
her physician only at intervals, a &ldquo;piano doctor&rdquo; is in
constant attendance on these instruments.</p>
<p>Paderewski&rsquo;s &ldquo;piano doctor&rdquo; has traveled with him
for several seasons, occupying the same private car and
practically living with him during the entire tour.
He was with him on the tour, in fact at his table at
breakfast with him, when his special train was run
on to an open siding near East Syracuse and left the
track, Paderewski being thrown forward on his hands
against the table and straining the muscles of one arm
so severely that he was obliged to cancel his remaining
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
engagements. Up to that time, however, his net
receipts from seventy-four concerts had been
$137,012.50, while before this American tour began
he gave thirty-six concerts in Australia with average
receipts of $5,000. His record concert was at Dallas,
Texas, some years ago, when the receipts were $9,000.
It occurred during a Confederate reunion. While he
was at the pianoforte, the various posts marched up to
the hall with bands and fife-and-drum corps playing.
Paderewski, however, kept right on through the blasts
and shrilling. But when one of the posts let out the
famous &ldquo;rebel yell,&rdquo; the pianist leaped from his seat
as if he expected a tiger to spring at his throat. Then
he realized what had happened, smiled and continued
amid laughter and applause. He had heard of the
famous &ldquo;rebel yell,&rdquo; but this was the first time he had
heard it.</p>
<h4>Pianofortes on Their Travels.</h4>
<p>But to return to the pianofortes on tour. When
Paderewski came to this country from Australia, his
piano doctor met him at San Francisco with four instruments
which had been selected with great care in
New York and been shipped West in charge of the
&ldquo;doctor.&rdquo; One of these the virtuoso reserved for his
private car, for he practices en route whenever there is
a stop long enough to make it worth while. He rarely
plays when the car is in motion. Of the other three
instruments, the two he liked best were sent to his
hotel, where during four days preceding his first concert,
he practiced from seven to eight hours a day,
notifying the &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; twenty-four hours in advance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
which pianoforte he would use. This instrument became,
officially, No. 1; the others No. 2 and No. 3.</p>
<p>The pianist&rsquo;s route took him from San Francisco to
Oakland, San José, and Portland, Oregon. To make
certain that he always will have a fine instrument to
play on, a method of shipping ahead the instruments
not in use is adopted. Thus, while he was playing on
No. 1 in San Francisco and Oakland, No. 2 was sent
on to San José and No. 3 to Portland. Of course,
none but an expert could detect the slightest difference
in these pianofortes, but a player like Paderewski is
sensitive to the most delicately balanced distinctions or
nuances in tone and action. One of his idiosyncrasies
is that always before going on he asks the &ldquo;doctor&rdquo;
which of the three instruments is on the stage, because,
as he himself expresses it, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to meet a
stranger.&rdquo; After each concert, at supper, this conversation
invariably takes place:</p>
<p>Paderewski: &ldquo;Well, &lsquo;Doctor,&rsquo; it sounded all right
to-night, didn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor&rdquo;: &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski: &ldquo;Well, then, please pass me the bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There never has been occasion to record what would
happen if the &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; were to say, &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo; For
he always has been able to answer in the affirmative,
with the most scrupulous regard for veracity.</p>
<p>Paderewski is as careful to play his best in the least
important place in which he gives a concert as he is in
New York. This high sense of duty toward his public
accounts in part for his supremacy among pianists
Paderewski is not a mere virtuoso. He is a man of fine
intellectual gifts who plays the piano like a poet. Paul
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
Potter, the playwright, who lives in Geneva, Switzerland,
and occasionally has dined there with Paderewski,
tells me that he has conversed with the pianist
on almost every conceivable subject <em>except music</em>
and always found him remarkably well informed.
His knowledge of the history of his native land, Poland,
and of its literature is said to be quite wonderful.
Chopin, also a Pole, he idolizes and regards
as far and away the greatest composer for the piano.
To the fund for the Chopin memorial at Warsaw he
contributes by charging one dollar for his autograph,
and two dollars for his signature and a few bars of
music. From the money received as the proceeds of
one season&rsquo;s autographs he was able to remit about
$1,300 to the fund.</p>
<p>When the amusing little dialogue at the supper table,
which I have recorded, takes place, the pianoforte
which the virtuoso has used at his concert already will
be on the way to its next destination. For it is part of
the &ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s&rdquo; duty to see it safely out of the hall and
onto the train before rejoining the party on the private
car. The instrument is not boxed. The legs are removed
and then a carefully fitted canvas is drawn over
the body and held in place by straps. The body is slid
out of the hall and slowly let down onto a specially constructed
eight-wheel skid, swung low, so as to be as
nearly as possible on a level with the platform. This
skid is part of the outfit of the tour. The record time
for detaching the legs of the pianoforte, covering the
body, removing the instrument from the stage and
having it on the skid ready to start for the station, is
seven minutes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span></div>
<h4>&ldquo;Thawing Out&rdquo; a Pianoforte.</h4>
<p>The instruments never are set up except under the
&ldquo;doctor&rsquo;s&rdquo; personal supervision. Before each concert
the pianoforte on which Paderewski is to play is carefully
gone over and put in perfect condition&mdash;tuned
and, if necessary, regulated, and this no matter how
recently he may have used it. Defects so trifling that
neither an ordinary player nor the public would notice
them, would jar on the sensitive ear and nerves of the
virtuoso. Sometimes the instrument has been exposed
to such a low temperature that frost is found to have
formed not only on the lid, but even on the iron plate
inside. In such cases the pianoforte is set up and, after
the film of frost has been scraped off, is allowed to thaw
out slowly and naturally before it is touched for tuning
or regulating.</p>
<p>There was an amusing incident in the handling of
one of the Paderewski instruments at Columbus,
Mississippi, where Paderewski played for seven hundred
girls at the State College, although it was more
exciting than diverting at the time it happened. The
&ldquo;doctor&rdquo; relies on local help for getting the pianoforte
from the skid to the stage and back again. Usually
efficient helpers are obtainable, but at Columbus, where
the college hall is upstairs and reached only by a narrow
flight of steps, there was no aid to be had save
from among the negroes lounging on the public square.
The &ldquo;doctor&rdquo; went among them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nawthin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want a job?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Naw, too busy,&rdquo; was the usual reply.</p>
<p>At last, however, a band of twenty &ldquo;colored gentlemen&rdquo;
was secured in the hope that muscle and quantity
would make up for lack of quality. But never before
has a high-grade pianoforte been in such imminent
peril. It was got upstairs well enough, in spite
of the fact that the negroes walked all over each other.
But the descent! The &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; Emil C. Fischer, stood
at the top of the stairs directing; J. E. Francke, the
treasurer of the tour, below. Around the latter fell a
shower of fragments from the wall, the rail, the posts;
and at one time it seemed as if the whole banister would
give way and the pianoforte crash in splinters on the
floor. There were other moments of suspense, for the
pianoforte as well as for the two watchers, who drew a
long breath when the instrument safely was on the
skid.</p>
<p>Fortunately such untoward incidents are forgotten
in the general atmosphere of good-humor which the
pianist diffuses about him. He enjoys his little joke.
During the last tour he handed a photograph of himself
to Mr. Francke inscribed: &ldquo;To the future Governor
of Hoboken.&rdquo; At the Auditorium hotel, Chicago,
Millward Adams&rsquo; brother, about leaving on a
trip, asked for an autograph. Paderewski, quick as a
flash, wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the brother of Mr. <i>Adams</i> on the <i>Eve</i> of his departure
from Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Paderewski travels on a special train. With him
usually are his wife, his manager, the treasurer of the
tour, the piano &ldquo;doctor,&rdquo; a secretary, valet and maid.
His home is a villa on Lake Geneva, where he has a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
beautiful garden and vinery, his dogs, his room for
billiards, a game of which he is very fond, and unlimited
opportunity for swimming, his favorite exercise.
Apparently slender and surely most poet-looking
at the piano, he is a man of iron strength as well as
of iron will.</p>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORCHESTRA</h3>
</div>
<p>The appreciation and consequent enjoyment of
an orchestral concert will be greatly enhanced
if the listener is familiar with certain details
regarding the orchestra itself and some of the compositions
he is apt to hear. This I have borne in mind
in the chapter divisions of this portion of my book, and,
as a result, I have divided the subject into the general
development of the orchestra, the specific consideration
of the principal orchestral instruments, a cursory commentary
on certain phases of orchestral music and a
chapter on Richard Strauss who represents its most
advanced aspects.</p>
<p>The first music of which we moderns take account
was unaccompanied (<i>à capella</i>) singing for
church service. It was composed in the old ecclesiastical
modes, which are quite different from
our modern scales, and the name which comes most
prominently to mind in connection with this beginning
of our musical history is that of Palestrina. With the
influence of this old church choral music so dominant,
there is little wonder that the first efforts to write
music for instruments were awkward. It may be said
right here that this awkwardness, or rather this lack
of knowledge and appreciation of the individual capacity
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span>
of various instruments, is shown throughout the
school of contrapuntal composition, even by Bach.
When Bach wrote for orchestral instruments he did
not consider their peculiar tone quality, or their capacity
for individual expression, but simply their pitch&mdash;which
instrument could take up this, that or the other
theme in his contrapuntal score, when he had carried
it as high or as low as he could on some other instrument.
This also is true of Händel, although in less
degree.</p>
<p>But just as we have seen that Domenico Scarlatti
worked along original lines for the pianoforte and created
the germ of the sonata form, while Bach was weaving
and plaiting the counterpoint of his suites, partitas
and &ldquo;Well-Tempered Clavichord,&rdquo; so in Italy, during a
large part of this contrapuntal period, a distinct kind of
orchestral music was springing up. Again, just as we
have seen that in Italy the pianoforte shook off the
trammels of counterpoint when it began to be used as
an accompaniment for dramatic recitative in opera, so
the instruments in the orchestra, when composers began
to use them for operatic accompaniments, were employed
more with reference to their individual tone
qualities and power of expression.</p>
<h4>Primitive Orchestral Efforts.</h4>
<p>Although, strictly speaking, not the first composer
to use orchestral instruments in opera, and to display
skill in utilizing their individual characteristics, the
most important of these early men was Claudio Monteverde
(1568-1643). In his &ldquo;Orpheo,&rdquo; which he produced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
in 1608, he utilized, besides two harpsichords
(and it may be of interest to note here that instruments
of the pianoforte class were long used in orchestras as
connecting links between all the other instruments),
two bass viols, two tenor viols, one double harp, two
little French violins, two large guitars, two wood organs,
two viola di gambas, one regal, four trombones,
two cornets, one octave flute, one clarion, and three
trumpets with mutes&mdash;a fairly formidable array of instruments
when the period is considered. Of especial
interest are the &ldquo;two little French violins,&rdquo; which probably
were the same as our modern violins, now the
prima donnas of the orchestra and far outnumbering
any other instrument employed.</p>
<p>It was Monteverde who in his &ldquo;Tancredi e Clorinda&rdquo;
made use for the first time of a tremolo for stringed
instruments, and it is said so to have astonished the
performers that they at first refused to play it. Before
Monteverde there were operatic composers like Jacopo
Peri, and after him Cavalli and Alessandro Scarlatti,
who did much for their day to develop the orchestra.
This is a very brief summary of the early development
of instrumental music, a story that easily could fill a
volume&mdash;which, probably, however, very few people
would take the trouble to read.</p>
<h4>Beethoven and the Modern Orchestra.</h4>
<p>The first really modern composer for the orchestra
was Joseph Haydn (1732-1809), who also may be considered
the father of the symphony. Born before Mozart,
he also survived that composer. His music is gay and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
naive; while Mozart, although he had decidedly greater
genius for the dramatic than Haydn, nevertheless is
only a trifle more emotional in his symphonies. The
three greatest of these which he composed during the
summer of 1788, the E flat major, G minor and
C major (known as the &ldquo;Jupiter&rdquo;), show a decided
advance in the knowledge of orchestration, and the
E flat major is notable because it is the first symphonic
work in which clarinets were used. Haydn&rsquo;s
and Mozart&rsquo;s symphonies&mdash;that is, the best of them&mdash;sound
agreeable even to-day in a concert hall of moderate
size. But because modern music with its sonorous
orchestra requires large auditoriums, like Carnegie
Hall in New York, these charming symphonic works
of the earlier classical period are swallowed up in
space and much of their naive and pretty effect is lost.</p>
<p>Beethoven may be said to have established the modern
orchestra. Very few instruments have been added
to it since his time, and if an orchestra to-day sounds
differently from what it did in his day, if the works
of modern composers sound richer and more effective
from a modern point of view than his orchestral compositions,
it is not because we have added a lot of new
instruments, but because our composers have acquired
greater skill in bringing out their peculiar tone qualities
and because the technique of orchestral players has
greatly improved.</p>
<p>It is for precisely the same reasons that Beethoven&rsquo;s
symphonies show such a great advance upon those of
his predecessors. The point is not that Beethoven
added a few more instruments to the orchestra, but
that, so far as his own purposes were concerned, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
handled all the instruments which he included in his
band with much greater skill than his predecessors had
shown. Many writers affect to despise technique.
But in point of fact the development of technique and
the development of art go hand in hand. An artist,
be he writer, painter or musician, cannot adequately
express his ideas unless he has the means of doing so
or the genius to create the means.</p>
<h4>How He Developed Orchestral Resources.</h4>
<p>In following Beethoven&rsquo;s symphonies from the First
to the Ninth, we can see the modern orchestra developing
under his hands from that handed over to him by
Haydn and Mozart. In the First and Second Symphonies,
Beethoven employs the usual strings, two
flutes, two oboes, two clarinets, two bassoons, two
horns, two trumpets and tympani. In the Third Symphony,
the &ldquo;Eroica,&rdquo; he adds a third horn part; in the
Fifth a piccolo, trombones and contrabassoon. Although
employed in the finale only, these instruments
here make their first bow in the symphonic orchestra.
In the Ninth Symphony Beethoven introduced two additional
horns, the first use of four horns in a symphony.
The scoring of these symphonies is given
somewhat more in detail in the chapter &ldquo;How the Orchestra
Grew,&rdquo; in Mr. W. J. Henderson&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Orchestra
and Orchestral Music,&rdquo; a well conceived and logically
developed book, in which the full story of the
orchestra and its growth is clearly and interestingly
told.</p>
<p>Beethoven not only understood to a greater degree
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span>
than his predecessors the peculiar characteristics of orchestral
instruments, he also compelled orchestral players
to acquire a better technique by giving them more
difficult music to execute. In point of greater difficulty
in performance, a Beethoven symphony holds
about the same relation to the symphonies of Mozart
and Haydn as the Beethoven pianoforte sonatas do to
the sonatas of those composers.</p>
<h4>Beethoven and Wagner.</h4>
<p>Just as Beethoven added only a few instruments to
the orchestra of his predecessors, but showed greater
skill in handling those instruments, so the modern
musician&mdash;a Wagner or a Richard Strauss&mdash;achieves
his striking instrumental effects by a still greater knowledge
of instrumental resources. The Beethoven orchestra
practically is the orchestra of to-day. Few,
very few, instruments have been added. Modern composers
steadily have asked for more and more instruments
in each group; but that is quite a different thing
from adding new instruments. They have required
more instruments of the same kind, but have asked for
very few instruments of new kinds. Let me illustrate
this by two modern examples.</p>
<p>Firm, compact and eloquent as is Beethoven&rsquo;s orchestra
in the Fifth Symphony, it cannot for a moment
be compared in richness, sonority, tone color, searching
power of expression and unflagging interest, with
Wagner&rsquo;s orchestra in &ldquo;Die Meistersinger.&rdquo; Yet Wagner
has added only one trumpet, a harp and a tuba
to the very orchestra which Beethoven employed when
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
he scored for the Fifth Symphony; while for his
&ldquo;Symphonie <a name='TC_3'></a><ins class="trchange" title="Was 'Pathètique'">Pathétique</ins>,&rdquo; one of the finest of modern
orchestral works, Tschaikowsky adds only a bass tuba
to the orchestra used by Beethoven. The simple fact
is that modern composers have studied every possible
phase of tone color and expression of which each instrument
is capable. Furthermore, by skillfully dividing
the orchestra into groups and using these groups
like separate orchestras, yet uniting them into one great
orchestra, they produce wonderfully rich contrapuntal
effects, and thus make the modern orchestra sound, not
seventy-five years, but five hundred years more advanced
than that of Beethoven, however great we
gladly acknowledge Beethoven to have been.</p>
<h4>Berlioz, an Orchestral Juggler.</h4>
<p>Following Beethoven, the next great development in
the handling of orchestral resources is due to Hector
Berlioz (1803-1869), and it is curious here how nearly
one musical epoch overlaps another. Scarlatti was
composing sonatas, and thus voicing the beginning of
the classical era, while Bach was bringing the contrapuntal
period to a close. It was only five years after
the completion of the Ninth Symphony that Berlioz&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Francs Juges&rdquo; overture was played. A year later his
&ldquo;Symphonie Fantastique, Episode de la Vie d&rsquo;un Artiste,&rdquo;
was brought out. Yet the Berlioz orchestra
sounds so utterly different from the Beethoven orchestra
that it almost might be a collection of different instruments.
Even more than Beethoven, Berlioz understood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
the individuality, the potential characteristics
of each instrument.</p>
<p>Berlioz composed on a colossal scale, so colossal that
his music has been called architectural. The &ldquo;Dies Irae&rdquo;
in his &ldquo;Requiem&rdquo; calls for four brass bands, in four different
corners of the hall, and for fourteen kettledrums
tuned to different notes, in addition to the regular orchestra,
chorus and soloists. This has been dubbed
&ldquo;three-story music&rdquo;&mdash;the orchestra on the ground floor,
the chorus on the <i>belle étage</i>, while the four extra brass
bands are stationed <i>aux troisième</i>. Unfortunately for
Berlioz, his ambition, in so far as it related to the art
of orchestration and the skill he showed in accomplishing
what he wanted to with his body of instrumentalists,
was far in excess of his inspiration. His knowledge
of the orchestra was sufficient to have afforded
him every facility for the expression of great
thoughts if he had them to express. But his
power of thematic invention, his gift for melody, was
not equal to his genius for instrumentation. Nevertheless,
through this genius for instrumentation&mdash;for his
technique was so extraordinary that it amounted to
genius&mdash;and through his very striving after bizarre,
unusual and gigantic effects, he contributed largely toward
the development of the technical resources of instrumental
music.</p>
<h4>Wagner, Greatest of Orchestral Composers.</h4>
<p>Berlioz wrote a book on instrumentation, which has
lately been re-edited by Richard Strauss. In it Strauss,
modestly ignoring himself, says that Wagner&rsquo;s scores
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
mark the only advance in orchestration worth mentioning
since Berlioz. It is true, the technical possibilities
of the orchestra were greatly improved, so far
as the woodwind was concerned, by the introduction
of keyed instruments constructed on the system invented
by Theobald Böhm; while the French instrument
maker, Adolphe Sax, also made important improvements
by perfecting the bass clarinet and the bass
tuba. But whatever aid Wagner derived from these
improvements merely was incidental to the principle
which is illustrated by every one of his scores&mdash;that
technique merely is a means to an end. Wagner is the
greatest orchestral virtuoso who ever breathed. Never,
however, does he employ technique for technique&rsquo;s
sake, but always only to enable his orchestra to convey
the exact meaning he has in his mind or express the
emotion he has in his heart, and he spares no pains to
hit upon the best method of conveying these ideas and
expressing these emotions. That is one reason why,
although no one with any knowledge of music could
mistake a passage by Wagner for any one else&rsquo;s music,
each of his works has its own peculiar orchestral style.
For each of his works reproduces through the orchestra
the &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo; of its subject. The scores of
&ldquo;Tannhäuser,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lohengrin,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Ring of the Nibelung,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Tristan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meistersinger&rdquo; and &ldquo;Parsifal&rdquo; never
could be mistaken for any one but Wagner&rsquo;s music.
Yet how different they are from each other! He
makes each instrument speak its own language.
When, for example, the English horn speaks through
Wagner, it speaks English, not broken English,
and so it is with all the other instruments of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
orchestra&mdash;he makes them speak without a foreign
accent.</p>
<p>If Wagner employs a large orchestra, it is not for
the sake of making a noise, but in order to gain variety
in expression. &ldquo;He is wonderfully reserved in the
use of his forces,&rdquo; says Richard Strauss. &ldquo;He employs
them as a great general would his battalions, and does
not send in an army corps to pick off a skirmisher.&rdquo;
Strauss regards &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; as a model score for a
somewhat advanced student, before proceeding to the
polyphony of &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Meistersinger&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
fairy region of the &lsquo;Nibelungs.&rsquo;&rdquo; &ldquo;The handling of the
wind instruments,&rdquo; writes Strauss, &ldquo;reaches a hitherto
unknown esthetic height. The so-called third woodwinds,
English horn and bass clarinet, added for the
first time to the woodwinds, are already employed in
a variety of tone color; the voices of the second, third
and fourth horn, trumpets and trombones established
in an independent polyphony, the doubling of melodic
voices characteristic of Wagner, carried out with such
assurance and freedom and knowledge of their characteristic
timbres, and worked out with an understanding
of tonal beauty, that to this day evokes unstinted
admiration. At the close of the second act the organ
tones that Wagner lures out of the orchestra triumph
over the queen of instruments itself.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>How Wagner Produces His Effects.</h4>
<p>The effects produced by Wagner are not due to a
large orchestra, but to his manner of using the instruments
in it. Among some of his special effects are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
the employment of full harmony with what formerly
would have been merely single passing notes, and above
all, the exploitation of every resource of counterpoint
in combination with the well developed system of harmony
inherited from Beethoven, but largely added to
by himself. In fact, Wagner&rsquo;s greatness is due to the
combination of several great gifts&mdash;his melodic inventiveness,
his rich harmony and his wonderful technical
skill in weaving together his themes in a still richer
counterpoint. This counterpoint is not, however, dry
and formal, because his themes&mdash;his leading motives&mdash;are
themselves full of emotional significance and not
conceived, like those of the old contrapuntists, merely:
for formal treatment.</p>
<p>Richard Strauss is such a master of orchestration
that I am inclined to quote his summary of the development
of the art of orchestration, from his edition of
the Berlioz book, which at this writing has not yet
been translated. I should like to recall to the reader&rsquo;s
mind, however, the fact that Strauss&rsquo; father was a
noted French-horn player; that Strauss himself has a
great love for the instrument; and that when, in summing
up the causes of Wagner&rsquo;s primacy among orchestral
writers, he finds one of them in the greater
technical facility of the valve horn, it is well to take
this with a grain of salt and attribute it somewhat
to his own affection for the instrument. The symphonies
of Haydn and Mozart, according to Strauss,
are enlarged string quartets with obbligato woodwind,
brass and tympani, and the occasional use of
other instruments of noise to strengthen the tuttis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even with Beethoven, the symphony is still simply
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
enlarged chamber music, the orchestra being treated in
a pianistic spirit which unfortunately shows itself even
in the orchestral work of Schumann and Brahms.
Wagner owes his polyphonic string quintet not to the
Beethoven orchestra, but to the last quartets of Beethoven,
in which each instrument is the peer of the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, another kind of orchestral work was
developing, for, from the time of Gluck on, the opera
orchestra was gaining in coloring and in individual
characteristics. Berlioz was not dramatic enough for
opera nor symphonic enough for the concert stage, yet
his efforts to write programmatic symphonies resulted
in his discovering new effects, new possibilities in tone
tints and in orchestral technics. Berlioz misses the
polyphony that enriches Wagner&rsquo;s orchestra, and
makes instruments like the second violins, violas, etc.,
second horns, etc., weave their threads or strands of
melody into the woof. Wagner&rsquo;s primacy is due to his
employment of the richest style of polyphony and counterpoint,
the increased possibility of this through the
invention of the valve horn, and his demand of solo
virtuosity upon his orchestral players. His scores mark
the only advance worth mentioning since Berlioz.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>INSTRUMENTS OF THE ORCHESTRA</h3>
</div>
<p>An orchestra is an aggregation of many instruments
which, under the baton of an able conductor,
should play as one, so far as precision
and expression are concerned. Separately, the instruments
are like the paints on a palette, and the result
of the composer&rsquo;s effort, like that of the painter&rsquo;s, depends
upon what he has to express and his knowledge
of how to use his materials in trying to express it.</p>
<p>The orchestra has developed into several distinct
groups, which are capable of playing independently, or
in union with each other, and within these groups themselves
there are various subdivisions. It is the purpose
of every modern composer who amounts to anything,
to get as many different quartets as possible out of his
orchestra. By this is meant a grouping of instruments
in such a way that as many groups as possible can play
in independent harmony.</p>
<p>It is through this system of orchestral groups that
Wagner has been able to enrich orchestral tone coloring,
and to say everything he wishes to say in exactly
the way it should be said. We cannot, for example,
imagine that the Love Motive in &ldquo;Die Walküre&rdquo; could
be made to sound more beautiful on its first entrance in
the score than it does. Nor could it. In that scene
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
it is exactly suited to a solo violoncello, and to a solo
violoncello Wagner gives it. In order, however, to
produce a perfectly homogenous effect, in order that
the violoncello quality of tone shall pervade not only
the melody, but also the supporting harmony, he supports
the melody with eight violoncellos, adding two
double basses to give more sonorousness to the deepest
note in the harmony. In other words he has made for
the moment a complete orchestra out of nine violoncellos
and two double basses, and produced a wondrously
rich and thrilling effect&mdash;because, having a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
beautiful melody to score, he knew just the instruments
for which to score it. This is an admirable example
of what technique accomplishes in the hands
of a genius. Another composer might have used an
orchestra of a hundred instruments and not have produced
the exquisite thrill that Wagner with his magical
orchestral touch conjures out of this group of violoncellos,
a group within a group, an orchestra of violoncellos
within the string band.</p>

<p>The woodwind instruments are capable of several
similar subdivisions. Flutes, oboes and bassoons, for
example, may form a group capable of producing independent
harmony, so can the clarinets, and the same
is the case with the brass instruments. One of Wagner&rsquo;s
most beautiful leading motives, the Walhalla Motive
in the &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung,&rdquo; is sounded on
four trombones. In brief, then, the modern composer
strives to constitute his orchestra in such a way that
he secures as many independent groups, and as many
little orchestras, as possible, not, however, for the purpose
of using them independently all the time, but
merely in order to do so occasionally for special effects
or to combine them whenever he sees fit in
order to enrich his tone coloring or weave his
polyphony.</p>
<p>The grand divisions of the orchestra are the strings&mdash;violins,
violas, violoncellos and double basses; the
woodwind, consisting, broadly speaking, of flutes,
oboes, clarinets and bassoons; the brass&mdash;horns, trumpets
and trombones; and the instruments of percussion,
or the &ldquo;battery&rdquo;&mdash;drums, triangles, cymbals and instruments
of that kind.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span></div>
<h4>The Prima Donna of the Orchestra.</h4>
<p>The leading instrument of the string group, and in
fact the leading instrument of the orchestra, is the
violin. The first violins are the prima donnas of
the orchestra, and one might say that it is almost
impossible to have too many of them. The first and
second violins should form about one-third of an orchestra,
and better still it would be for the number to
exceed that proportion. The Boston Symphony Orchestra,
which has about eighty-one players, has thirty
violins. Theodore Thomas&rsquo;s New York Festival Orchestra
in 1882, consisting of three hundred and fourteen
instruments, had one hundred violins.</p>
<p>Great is the capacity of the violin. Its notes may be
crisp, sharp, decisive, brilliant, or long-drawn-out and
full of emotion. It has greater precision of attack than
any other instrument in the orchestra. And right here
it is interesting to note that while the multiplication of
instruments gives greater sonority, it also gives much
finer effects in soft passages. The pianissimo of one
hundred violins is a very much finer pianissimo and at
the same time infinitely richer and further carrying
than the pianissimo of a solo violin. It is the very
acme of a musical stage whisper.</p>
<p>In this very first and most important group of the
orchestra we can find examples of utilizing subdivisions
of groups. Although the violin cannot be played lower
than its G string, which sounds the G below the treble
clef, the violin group nevertheless has been employed
entirely by itself, and even subdivided within itself.
The most exquisite example of this, one cited in every
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
work on the orchestra worth reading, is the &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;
prelude. To this the violins are divided into
four groups and on the highest register, with an effect
that is most ethereal.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Modern orchestral virtuosity may be gauged by the
statement that while Beethoven but once dared to score
for his violins above the high F, Richard Strauss in
the most casual manner carries them an octave higher.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span></div>
<p>A little contrivance of wood or metal, with teeth,
can be pressed down over the strings of the violin so
as to deaden its vibrations. This is called the sordine,
or mute. A famous example of the use of the violins
<i>con sordini</i> is the Queen Mab Scherzo in Berlioz&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Romeo et Juliette Symphonie.&rdquo; Another well-known
use of the same effect is in Asa&rsquo;s Death, in Grieg&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Peer Gynt&rdquo; Suite. Nothing can be more exquisite
than the entrance of the muted violins after a long
silence, in the last act of &ldquo;Tristan und Isolde,&rdquo; just
before <i>Isolde</i> intones the Love Death.</p>
<p>An unusual effect is produced by using the back of
the bow instead of the horsehair. Liszt uses it
in his symphonic poem, &ldquo;Mazeppa,&rdquo; for imitating the
snorting of the horse; Wagner in &ldquo;Siegfried,&rdquo; for accompanying
the mocking laugh of <i>Mime</i>; and Richard
Strauss in &ldquo;Feuersnot,&rdquo; to produce the effect of crackling
flames. But, as Strauss remarks in his revision
of Berlioz&rsquo;s work on instrumentation, it is effective
only with a large orchestra. The plucking of the
strings with the fingers&mdash;pizzicato&mdash;is a familiar device.
Tschaikowski employed it almost throughout an
entire movement, the &ldquo;Pizzicato Ostinato&rdquo; in his
Fourth Symphony.</p>
<h4>Viola, Violoncello and Double Bass.</h4>
<p>The viola is a deeper violin, with a very beautiful
and expressive tone. Méhul, the French composer,
scored his one-act opera, &ldquo;Uthal,&rdquo; without violins, employing
the viola as the highest string instrument in his
score. This, however, was not a success, the brilliant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
tone of the violin being missed more and more as the
performance of the work progressed, until Grétry is
said to have risen in his seat and exclaimed: &ldquo;A thousand
francs for an E string!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meyerbeer, who was among the first to appreciate
the beauty of the viola as a solo instrument, used a
single viola for the accompaniment to <i>Raoul&rsquo;s</i> romance,
&ldquo;Plus blanche que la blanche hermine,&rdquo; in the first act
of &ldquo;Les Huguenots.&rdquo; Strictly speaking, he wrote it
for the viola d&rsquo;amour, which is somewhat larger than
the ordinary viola; but it almost always is played on
the latter. Berlioz made exquisite use of it in his
&ldquo;Harold Symphony,&rdquo; practically making a <i>dramatis
persona</i> of it, for in the score a solo viola represents
the melancholy wanderer; and in his &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo;
Richard Strauss assigns to the instrument an equally
important rôle.</p>
<p>The violoncello is one of the most tenderly expressive
of all the instruments in the orchestra. Beethoven
employs it for the theme of the slow movement in his
Fifth Symphony, and although the viola joins with the
violoncello in playing this melody, the passage owes its
beauty chiefly to the latter. One of the most exquisite
melodies in all symphonic music is the theme which
Schubert has given to the violoncellos in the first movement
of his &ldquo;Unfinished Symphony.&rdquo; They also are
used with wonderfully expressive effect in the &ldquo;Tristan
Vorspiel.&rdquo; Rossini gives a melodious passage, in the
introduction to the overture to &ldquo;William Tell,&rdquo; to five
violoncellos. But the most striking employment of the
violoncellos as an independent group is in the Love
Motive in the first act of &ldquo;Die Walküre.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>Double basses first were used to simply double the
violoncello part in the harmony. But through Beethoven&rsquo;s
employment of them in the Fifth and Ninth
Symphonies, in the former for a remarkably effective
passage in the Scherzo and in the latter for a highly
dramatic recitative, their importance as independent instruments
in the orchestra was established. Verdi has
made very effective use of them in the scene in &ldquo;Otello&rdquo;
as the <i>Moor</i> approaches <i>Desdemona&rsquo;s</i> bed. In the introduction
to &ldquo;Rheingold,&rdquo; Wagner has half his double
basses tuned down to E flat, which is half a note deeper
than the usual range of the instrument, and in the second
act of &ldquo;Tristan und Isolde&rdquo; two basses are obliged
to tune their E string down to C sharp.</p>
<h4>Dividing the String Band.</h4>
<p>I have pointed out several examples in which the
groups of instruments in the string band are divided
within themselves, as in the prelude to &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;
and in the first act of &ldquo;Die Walküre.&rdquo; The entire
string band can be divided and subdivided with telling
effect, when done by a master. When in the second
act of &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo; <i>Brangäne</i> warns the lovers from her
position on the watch-tower, the accompaniment stirs
the soul to its depth, because it gives the listener such
a weird thrill of impending danger that he almost longs
to inform the lovers of their peril. In this passage
Wagner divides the string band into no less than
fifteen parts. In the thunder-storm in &ldquo;Rheingold&rdquo;
the strings are divided into twenty-one parts. Richard
Strauss points out how in the introduction to &ldquo;Die
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
Walküre&rdquo; much of the stormy effect is produced by
strings only&mdash;sixteen second violins, twelve violas,
twelve violoncellos and four double basses&mdash;a storm
for strings where another composer would have unleashed
a whole orchestra, including cymbals and bass
drum, and crashed and thrashed about without producing
a tithe of Wagner&rsquo;s effect! He also cites the
tremolo at the beginning of the second act of &ldquo;Tristan&rdquo;
as a wonderful example of tone painting which produces
the effect of whispering foliage and conveys to
the audience a sense of mystery and danger.</p>
<p>Theodore Thomas always was insistent that the
various divisions of a string band should bow exactly
alike. It is said that he once stopped an orchestra
because he had detected something wrong with the
tonal effect, and, after watching the players, had discovered
that one violoncellist among sixteen was bowing
differently from the others. Richard Strauss, on
the other hand, never insists on the same bowing
throughout each division of strings. He thinks it robs
the melody of intensity and beauty if each individual
is not allowed to play according to his own peculiar
temperament.</p>
<h4>A Passage in &ldquo;Die Walküre.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>In the Magic Fire Scene in the finale of &ldquo;Die
Walküre,&rdquo; Wagner wrote violin passages which not
even the greatest soloist can play cleanly, yet which,
when played by all the violins, simulate in <em>sound</em> the
<em>aspect</em> of licking, circling flames. Indeed, the effects
that Wagner understood how to draw from the orchestral
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
instruments are little short of marvellous.
In the &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; prelude the tone quality of the
violins is absolutely angelic in purity; while in the third
act of &ldquo;Siegfried,&rdquo; the upswinging violin passages as
the young hero reaches the height where <i>Brünnhilde</i>
slumbers, depict the action with a thrilling realism.</p>
<p>Besides the regular string band, Wagner made frequent
use of the harp. It is related that at the Munich
performance of &ldquo;Rheingold,&rdquo; when the harpist Trombo
protested to him that some of the passages were
unplayable, the composer replied: &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t expect
me to play the harp, too, do you? You perceive the
general effect I am aiming at; produce that and I shall
be satisfied.&rdquo; Liszt, in his &ldquo;Dante Symphony,&rdquo; uses
the <i>glissando</i> of the harp as a symbol for the rising
shades of <i>Francesco da Rimini</i> and her lover, and a very
beautiful use of harmonics on the harp with their faint
tinkle is to be found in the Waltz of the Sylphs in
Berlioz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Damnation de Faust.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The Woodwind.</h4>
<p>Flutes, oboes and clarinets form the woodwind. One
of the best known passages for flute is in the third
&ldquo;Leonora Overture&rdquo; of Beethoven, where it is employed
with conspicuous grace. Probably, however,
more fun has been made of the flute than of any other
orchestral instrument, and a standard musical joke runs
as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you musical?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but I have a brother who plays the flute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It has also been insinuated that in Donizetti&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
&ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; the heroine goes mad, not because she has
been separated from <i>Edgardo</i>, but because a flute obbligato
accompanies her principal aria. The piccolo is
a high flute used for shrill effects.</p>
<p>The instruments of both the oboe and clarinet families
are reed instruments, with this difference, however:
the instruments of the oboe family have two
vibrating reeds in the mouthpieces; those of the clarinet
family, only one. The oboe family consists of the oboe
proper, the English horn which is an alt oboe, and the
bassoon which is the bass of this group of instruments.
In Italian the bassoon is called a <i>fagotto</i>, a name derived
from its supposed resemblance to a bundle of
fagots. &ldquo;Candor, artless grace, tender joy, or the
grief of a fragile soul, are found in the oboe&rsquo;s accents,&rdquo;
says Berlioz of this instrument, and those who remember
the exquisite oboe melody, with which the slow
movement of Schubert&rsquo;s C major symphony opens,
will agree with the French composer. Richard
Strauss, in his &ldquo;Sinfonia Domestica,&rdquo; employs the almost
obsolete oboes d&rsquo;amore to represent an &ldquo;innocent,
dreamy, playful child.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>The English Horn in &ldquo;Tristan.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>The most famous use of the English horn is found
in the third act of &ldquo;Tristan,&rdquo; where it plays the &ldquo;sad
lay&rdquo; while <i>Tristan</i> awaits news of the ship which is
bearing <i>Isolde</i> toward him, and changes to a joyous
strain when the ship is sighted. The bassoon and contrabassoon,
besides their value as the bass of the oboe
family, have certain humorous qualities, which are admirably
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span>
brought out in Beethoven&rsquo;s Fifth and Ninth
Symphonies and in the march of the clownish artisans
in Mendelssohn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Midsummer Night&rsquo;s Dream&rdquo; music.
In opera, Meyerbeer made the bassoon famous by his
scoring of the dance of the <i>Spectre Nuns</i> in &ldquo;Robert le
Diable&rdquo; for it, and he also used it for the accompaniment
to the female chorus in the second act of &ldquo;Les Huguenots.&rdquo;
The theme of the romanza, &ldquo;Una fortiva lagrima,&rdquo;
in Donizetti&rsquo;s &ldquo;L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;Amore,&rdquo; which Caruso
sings so beautifully, is introduced by the bassoon,
and with charming effect.</p>
<p>The clarinets have a large compass. Usually three
kinds of clarinets (in A, B flat and C because they
are transposing instruments) are employed in the orchestra,
besides the bass clarinet. The possibilities of
the clarinet group have been enormously developed by
Wagner. It is necessary only to recall the scene of
<i>Elsa&rsquo;s</i> bridal procession to the cathedral in the second
act of &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo;; <i>Elisabeth&rsquo;s</i> sad exit after her
prayer in the third act of &ldquo;Tannhäuser,&rdquo; in which the
melody is played by the bass clarinet, while the accompaniment
is given to three flutes and eight other clarinets;
the change of scene in the first act of &ldquo;Götterdämmerung,&rdquo;
when clarinets give forth the Brünnhilde
Motive; and passages in the second act of &ldquo;Die Meistersinger,&rdquo;
in the scene at nightfall; while for a generally
skillful use of the woodwind the introduction to
the third act of &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; is a shining example.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span></div>
<h4>Brass Instruments.</h4>
<p>People usually associate the brass instruments with
noise. But as a matter of fact, wonderfully rich and
soft tone effects can be produced on the brass by a
composer who knows how to score for it. Just as the
pianissimo of many violins is a finer pianissimo than
that of a solo violin, so a much more exquisitely soft
effect can be produced on a large brass group than on
a few brass instruments or a single one. When modern
composers increase the number of instruments in
the brass group, it is not for the sake of noise, but for
richer effects.</p>
<p>The trumpet is the soprano of the brass family.
The fanfare in &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; when at the critical moment
aid approaches; the Siegfried Motive and the Sword
Motive, in the &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung,&rdquo; need only be
cited to prove the effectiveness of the instrument in
its proper place; and Richard Strauss instances the demoniacal
and fateful effect of the deep trumpet tones
in the introduction to the first act of Bizet&rsquo;s &ldquo;Carmen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although the notes of the trombone are produced
by a slide, this instrument belongs to the trumpet family.
For this reason, in the &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung,&rdquo;
Wagner, in addition to the usual three tenor trombones,
reintroduced the almost obsolete bass trombone. He
wanted a trombone group complete in itself, and thus
to be able to utilize the peculiar tone color of the instrument;
as witness in the Walhalla Motive, where it is
scored for the three tenor trombones and bass trombone,
resulting in a wonderfully rich and velvety quality
of tone. Excepting Wagner and Richard Strauss,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
there probably is not a composer who would not have
used the bass tuba here instead of taking the trouble to
revive the bass trombone. But Wagner wanted an
unusually rich tone which should be solemn without a
trace of sombreness, and his keen instrumental color
sense informed him that he could secure it with the
bass trombone, which, as it belongs to the trumpet family,
has a touch of trumpet brilliancy, whereas the
tone of the bass tuba is darker.</p>

</div>
<p>Mozart employed the trombone with fine effect in
<i>Sarastro&rsquo;s</i> solo in the &ldquo;Magic Flute&rdquo;; Schubert showed
his genius for instrumentation by the manner in which
he used them in the introduction to his C major symphony,
as well as in the first movement of that symphony,
in which a theme is given out by three trombones
in unison; and another familiar example of good
scoring for trombones is in the introduction to the third
act of &ldquo;Lohengrin.&rdquo; In the Death Prophecy scene in
the second act of &ldquo;Die Walküre,&rdquo; a trumpet melody is
supported by the four trombones, another instance
of Wagner&rsquo;s sense of homogeneity in sound, since
trumpets and trombones belong to the same family. In
fact, throughout the &ldquo;Ring,&rdquo; as Strauss points out,
Wagner wrote for his trombones in four parts, adding
the bass trombone in order to differentiate wholly between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
it and the tuba, which latter he used with the
horns, with which it is properly grouped.</p>
<p>Wagner has a tremendous tuba recitative in a &ldquo;Faust
Overture,&rdquo; and in the Funeral March in the &ldquo;Götterdämmerung&rdquo;
he introduces tenor tubas in order, again,
to differentiate between the tone color of tubas and
trombones and not to be obliged to employ trombones
in this particular scene, the general tone color of the
tuba being far more sombre than that of the trombone.</p>
<h4>Richard Strauss&rsquo;s Tribute to the Horn.</h4>
<p>To mention tubas and trombones before the horns
is very much like putting the cart before the horse, but
I have reserved the horns for the last of the brass on
account of the great tribute which Richard Strauss has
paid them. In the early orchestras one rarely found
more than two horns. Beethoven used four in the
Ninth Symphony, and now it is not at all unusual to
find eight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all instruments,&rdquo; says Richard Strauss, &ldquo;the horn
is perhaps the one that best can be joined with other
groups. To substantiate this in all its numerous phases,
I should be obliged to quote the entire &lsquo;Meistersinger&rsquo;
score. For I do not think I exaggerate when I maintain
that the greatly developed technique of the valve
horn has made it possible that a score which, with the
addition of a third trumpet, a harp and a tuba, employs
the same instruments as Beethoven used in his
Fifth Symphony, has become with every bar something
entirely different, something wholly new and
unheard of.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Surely the two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets and
two bassoons of Mozart have been exhausted by Wagner
in every direction of their technical possibilities and
plastically combined with an almost weird perception
of all their tone secrets; the string quintet, through the
most refined divisions into parts, and with added
brilliance through the employment of the harp, produces
innumerable new tone effects, and by superb polyphony
is brought to a height and warmth of emotional
expression such as never before was dreamed
of; trumpet and trombones are made to express every
phase of solemn or humorous characterization&mdash;but the
main thing is the tireless participation of the horn, now
for the melody, now for filling out, now as bass. The
&lsquo;Meistersinger&rsquo; score is the horn&rsquo;s hymn of praise.
Through the introduction and perfection of the valve
horn the greatest improvement in the technique of scoring,
since Berlioz&rsquo;s day, has been made possible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To illustrate exhaustively this Protean character
of the horn, I should like (again!) to go through the
scores of the great magician, bar by bar, beginning with
&lsquo;Rheingold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whether it rings through the primeval German forest
with the sunny exuberance of <i>Siegfried&rsquo;s</i> youthful
heart and joy of living; whether in Liszt&rsquo;s &lsquo;Mazeppa&rsquo;
it dies out in the last hoarse gasp of the Cossack prince
nigh unto death in the vast desert of the steppes;
whether it conjures the childlike longing of <i>Siegfried</i>
for the mother he never has known; whether it hovers
over the gently undulating sea which is to bring <i>Isolde&rsquo;s</i>
gladdening form to the dying <i>Tristan</i>, or nods <i>Hans
Sachs&rsquo;</i> thanks to the faithful <i>&rsquo;Prentice</i>; whether in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
<i>Erik&rsquo;s</i> dream it causes in a few hollow accents the
North Sea to break on the lonely coast; bestows upon
the apples of Freia the gift of eternal youth; pokes
fun at the curtain-heroes (&lsquo;Meistersinger,&rsquo; Act III);
plies the cudgels on <i>Beckmesser</i> with the jealous <i>David</i>
and his comrades, and is the real instigator of the riot;
or sings in veiled notes of the wounds of <i>Tristan</i>&mdash;always
the horn, in its place and to be relied on, responds,
unique in its manifold meanings and its brilliant
significance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Famous horn passages in the works of other composers
are in the trio of the Scherzo in the &ldquo;Eroica
Symphony&rdquo;; in the second movement of Schubert&rsquo;s C
major symphony, the passage of which Schumann
said that the notes of the horns just before the return
of the principal subject were like the voice of an
angel; in the opening of Weber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freischütz&rdquo; overture;
in the introduction to <i>Michaela&rsquo;s</i> romance in
&ldquo;Carmen&rdquo;; and in the opening theme of the slow movement
of Tschaikowsky&rsquo;s Fifth Symphony, which is the
perfection of a melodic phrase for solo horn.</p>
<p>Instruments of Percussion.</p>
<p>In the &ldquo;battery&rdquo; the instruments of prime importance
are the tympani. Beethoven gave the cue to
what could be accomplished with these in the scherzo
of the Fifth Symphony and also in the octave thumps
in the scherzo of the Ninth Symphony, while for a
weirdly sombre effect there is nothing equal to the faint
roll of the tympani at the beginning and end of the
Funeral March in &ldquo;Götterdämmerung.&rdquo; Cymbals are
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
used in several ways. Besides the ordinary clash,
Wagner has produced a sound somewhat like that of a
gong, by the sharp stroke of a drum-stick on one cymbal,
and also a roll by using a pair of drum-sticks on
one cymbal.</p>
<p>Among composers since Beethoven, Weber, Liszt,
Saint-Saëns, Dvorak, Tschaikowsky, and, of course,
Richard Strauss&mdash;it hardly is necessary to mention
either Berlioz or Wagner again&mdash;have shown brilliant
technique in orchestration. On the other hand, Schumann
and Brahms do not appear to have understood or
to have taken the trouble to understand the individual
characteristics of orchestral instruments, and, as a result,
their works for orchestra are not as effective as
they should be. Their orchestration has been called
&ldquo;muddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is Richard Strauss&rsquo;s opinion that the next advancement
in orchestration will be brought about by
adding largely to certain groups of instruments which
now have only comparatively few representatives in the
orchestra. He instances that at the Brussels Conservatory
one of the professors had Mozart&rsquo;s G minor
symphony performed for him on twenty-two clarinets,
of which four were basset horns (alto clarinets),
two brass clarinets, and one contra-bass clarinet; and
he suggests that it will be along such lines that the
orchestra of the future will be enlarged. With an orchestra
with all the family groups of instruments complete
in the manner suggested by Strauss, and used by
a musical genius, a genius who combines with melodic
invention virtuosity of instrumentation, marvellous results
are yet to be achieved.</p>

<h2>XI</h2>
<h3>CONCERNING SYMPHONIES</h3>
</div>
<p>I have said that music, like all other arts, had a
somewhat formless beginning, then gradually acquired
form, then became too rigidly formal, and
in modern times, while not discarding form, has become
freer in its expression of emotion.</p>
<p>Instrumental music, since the beginning of the classical
period, has been governed largely by the symphony,
which the reader should bear in mind is nothing more
than a sonata for orchestra, the form having first developed
on the pianoforte and having been handed over
by it to the aggregation of instruments. Sir Hubert
Parry, from whose book, &ldquo;The Evolution of the Art of
Music,&rdquo; I have had previous occasion to quote, has
several apt paragraphs concerning the earlier development
of the sonata, which of course apply with equal
force to the symphony. After stating that the instinct
of the composers who first sought the liberation of
music from the all-predominating counterpoint, impelled
them to develop movements of wider and freer
range, which should admit of warm melodic expression,
without degenerating into incoherent, rambling ecstasy,
Sir Hubert continues: &ldquo;They had the sense to see
from the first that mere formal continuous melody is
not the most suitable type for instrumental music.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span>
There is deep-rooted in the matter of all instrumental
music the need of some rhythmic vitality. These composers
then set themselves to devise a scheme in which,
to begin with, the contour of connected melodic phrases,
supported and defined by simple harmonic accompaniment,
gave the impression of definite tonality&mdash;that is,
of being decisively in some particular key and giving
an unmistakable indication of it. They found out how
to proceed by giving the impression of using that key
and passing to another without departing from the
characteristic spirit and mood of the music, as shown
in the &lsquo;subjects&rsquo; and figures; and how to give the impression
of relative completeness, by closing in a key
which is in strong contrast to the first, and so round
off one-half of the design.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this point being in apposition to the starting
point, leaves the mind dissatisfied and in expectation
of fresh disclosures; so they made the balance complete
by resuming the subjects and melodic figures of
the first part in extraneous keys, and working back
to the starting point; and they made their final close
with the same figures as were used to conclude the first
half, but in the principal key instead of the key of
contract.&rdquo; This is a somewhat more elaborate method
of describing the sonata form than I have adopted
in the division of this book relating to the pianoforte.</p>
<h4>Esthetic Purpose of the Symphony.</h4>
<p>Later on in his book, Sir Hubert, in discussing the
type of sonata movement which was fairly established
by the time of Haydn and Mozart, gives a simpler
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
esthetic explanation, pointing out that the first part
of the movement aims at definiteness of subject, definiteness
of contrast of keys, definiteness of regular balancing
groups of bars and rhythms, definiteness of progressions.
By the time this first division is over the
mind has had enough of such definiteness, and wants
a change. The second division, therefore, represents
the breaking up of the subjects into their constituent
elements of figure and rhythm, the obliteration of the
sense of regularity by grouping the bars irregularly;
and aims, by moving constantly from key to key, to
give the sense of artistic confusion; which, however, is
always regulated by some inner but disguised principle
of order. When the mind has gone through enough
of the pleasing sense of bewilderment&mdash;the sense
that has made riddles attractive to the human creature
from time immemorial&mdash;the scheme is completed
by resuming the orderly methods of the first division
and firmly re-establishing the principal theme
which has been carefully avoided since the commencement.</p>
<p>The earlier symphonic writers usually wrote their
symphonies in three movements: the first or sonata
movement; a second slow movement in a simpler type
of form, usually of the song, aria, or rondo type; and
a final movement in lively time, also usually adapted
to the rondo form. Concerning this three-movement
symphony of the early writers, it was said by an old-time
wit that they wrote the first movement to show
what they could do, the second movement to show
what they could feel, and the third movement to show
how glad they were it was over&mdash;and this may be said
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
to describe the view of the ultra-modern music-lover
toward rigidity of form in general.</p>
<p>Regarding form in music there is much prejudice one
way or the other. The sonnet in poetry certainly is a
rigid form; and yet those poets who have mastered it
have produced extremely effective and highly artistic
poems, and poems abounding in profound emotional
expression. Walt Whitman, on the other hand, was
quite formless, and yet he is sure to be ranked in time
as one of the greatest poets of his age. Wagner&rsquo;s
idea was that the symphonic form had reached its
climax with Beethoven&rsquo;s Ninth Symphony; yet it is
by no means incredible that if Wagner in his maturer
years had undertaken to compose a symphony, the result
would have disproved his own theory.</p>
<h4>Seems to Hamper Modern Composers.</h4>
<p>The symphonic form, however, or, to be more exact,
the sonata form, seems to hamper every modern composer
when he writes for the pianoforte, and the fact
that most of Beethoven&rsquo;s pianoforte music was written
in this form appears to be the reason for his works
somewhat falling into disuse. On the other hand, the
form is undoubtedly holding out better in the orchestral
version of the sonata, the symphony, because the tone
color of orchestral instruments gives it greater variety.
Tschaikowsky, Dvorak and Brahms have worked successfully,
and the two former even brilliantly, in this
form; and if Brahms in his symphonies appears too
continent, too classically reserved, it would seem to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
be not so much the form itself which is to blame, as
his lack of skill in instrumentation.</p>
<p>My own personal preference is for the freer form
developed by Liszt in the symphonic poem, in which
a leading motive, or possibly several motives skillfully
varied dominate the whole composition and give it
esthetic and psychological unity; and for the still freer
development of instrumental music in the tone poem
of Richard Strauss. But neither the symphonic poems
of Liszt nor the tone poems of Strauss are formless
music. That should be well understood, although it
should be borne in mind with equal distinctness that
these manifestations of the genius of two great composers
show a complete liberation from the shackles of
the classical symphony. In the end the test is found
in the music itself. If the music of a symphonic poem
which sets out to express a given title or a given
motto, if the music of a tone poem which starts out
to interpret a programmatic story or device, is worthy
to be ranked with the great productions of the art, it
not only is profoundly interesting as music, but gains
immensely in interest through its incidental secondary
meaning. It is the old story of art for art&rsquo;s sake&mdash;art
for the purpose of merely gratifying the eye or
the ear&mdash;or art for the purpose of conveying something
besides itself to the beholder or the listener; and it
seems to me that, in the history of the art, art for art&rsquo;s
sake has always been the more primitive expression
and eventually has been obliged to give way.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span></div>
<h4>The Naive Symphonists.</h4>
<p>At the risk of repeating what already has been said
of the sonata, the symphony may be described as a work
in four movements&mdash;the first movement, usually an
Allegro, sometimes with a slow introduction, but more
frequently without one; a second movement, ordinarily
called the slow movement, and usually in Adagio or
Andante; a third movement, either minuet or scherzo;
and a final movement in fast time and usually in
rondo form. It was Haydn who pretty definitely established
these divisions of the symphony. He composed
in all one hundred and twenty-five symphonies,
of which only a few appear on modern concert programs,
and even these but occasionally. Their music
is marked by a simplicity bordering on naïveté, and
the orchestration is a string quartet with a mere filling
out by other instruments. Mozart was of a deeper
and more dramatic nature than Haydn, and the expression
of his thought was more intense. In the same
way, there is a greater warmth and color in his orchestration.
Nevertheless, the three finest of his forty-nine
symphonies, the E flat, G minor and Jupiter,
composed in 1788, seem almost childlike in their artless
grace and beauty to us moderns.</p>
<p>Beethoven&rsquo;s first two symphonies were written under
the influence of Haydn and Mozart, but with the third
he becomes distinctly epic in his musical utterance; and
this symphony, both in regard to variety and depth of
expression and skillful use of orchestral instruments,
is as great an advance upon the work of his predecessors
as, let us say, Tschaikowsky is upon Mendelssohn.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span></div>
<h4>Beethoven to the Fore.</h4>
<p>There are apparent in the sequences of Beethoven&rsquo;s
symphonies certain climaxes and certain rests. Thus
the Third is the climax of the first three. The Fourth
is far less profound; the master relaxes. But the
Fifth, with its compact, vigorous theme, which Beethoven
himself is said to have described as Fate knocking
at the door, and his skillful introduction of this
theme in varied form in each of the movements, is by
many regarded as his masterpiece&mdash;even greater than
the Ninth. After this he seems to have relaxed again
in the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth, in order to prepare
himself for the climax of his career in his final symphonic
work, the Ninth. In the slow movement of
the Sixth (the &ldquo;Pastoral&rdquo;), in which he imitates the
call of birds, he gives the direction: &ldquo;<i>mehr Empfindung
als Malerei</i>&rdquo; (more feeling than painting), a direction
which often is quoted by opponents of modern program
music; notwithstanding the fact that Beethoven,
in spite of his own qualifying words, straightway indulged
in &ldquo;painting&rdquo; of the most childish description.
The Seventh Symphony is an extremely brilliant work
and the Eighth an exceedingly joyous one, while with
the Ninth, as though he himself felt that he was going
beyond the limits of orchestral music, he introduced in
the last movement solo singers and a chorus, but not
with as much effect as the employment of this unusual
scheme might lead one to anticipate, because, unfortunately,
his writing for voices is extremely awkward.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span></div>
<h4>Schubert&rsquo;s Genius.</h4>
<p>Like Beethoven, Schubert wrote nine symphonies,
but the &ldquo;Unfinished,&rdquo; which was his eighth, and the
C major, his ninth, which was discovered by Schumann
in the possession of Schubert&rsquo;s brother and sent
to Mendelssohn for production at Leipzig, are the ones
which seem destined to survive. They are among the
most beautiful examples of orchestral music&mdash;the first
movement of the &ldquo;Unfinished Symphony&rdquo; full of dramatic
moments as well as of exquisite melody, the slow
movement a veritable rose of orchestration; while as
regards the C major symphony, Schumann&rsquo;s reference
to its &ldquo;heavenly length&rdquo; sufficiently describes its
inspiration.</p>
<p>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Italian and Scotch symphonies are his
best known orchestral works. They are clear and serene,
and for any one who thinks a symphony is something
very abstruse and wants to be gradually familiarized
with its mysteries, they form an easily taken
and innocuous dose&mdash;the symphony made palatable.
Of Schumann&rsquo;s four symphonies, the one in E flat, the
&ldquo;Rhenish,&rdquo; supposed to represent a series of impressions
of the Rhine country, the fourth movement especially,
to represent the exaltation which possessed his
soul during a religious ceremony in the cathedral at
Cologne; and the D minor, which latter really is a
fantasia, deserve to rank highest. In the D minor
the movements follow each other without pause; there
is a certain thematic relationship between the first and
the last movements, and this connection gives the work
a freer and more modern effect. But Schumann was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
either indifferent to, or ignorant of, the advance in
orchestration which had taken place since Beethoven.
Practically the same thing applies to Brahms, who,
however, deserves the credit for introducing into the
symphony a new style of movement, the intermezzo,
which takes the place of the scherzo or minuet. Rubinstein
deserves &ldquo;honorable mention&rdquo;; but the most modern
heroes of symphony are Dvorak, with his &ldquo;New
World,&rdquo; and Tschaikowsky, with his &ldquo;Pathétique.&rdquo;
Such works are life-preservers that may help keep a
sinking art form afloat. But modern orchestral music
is tending more and more toward the symphonic poem
and the tone poem.</p>
<p>Liszt has written two symphonies: the &ldquo;Faust Symphony,&rdquo;
consisting of three movements, which represent
the three principal characters of Goethe&rsquo;s drama,
<i>Faust</i>, <i>Gretchen</i>, and <i>Mephistopheles</i>; and a symphony
to Dante&rsquo;s &ldquo;Divina Commedia.&rdquo; In both these symphonies
a chorus is introduced. Of his symphonic
poems, the best known are &ldquo;Les Préludes,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tasso,
Lamento e Trionfo.&rdquo; In these symphonic poems Liszt
has made use of the principle of the leitmotif in orchestral
music. They are dramatic episodes for orchestra,
superbly instrumentated, profoundly beautiful
in thought and intention&mdash;great program music in fact,
because conceived in accordance with the highest canons
of the art, and infinitely more interesting than
&ldquo;pure&rdquo; music because they mean something. By some
people Liszt is regarded as a mere charlatan, by others
as a great composer. Not only was he a great composer,
but one of the very greatest.</p>
<p>The Saint-Saëns symphonic poems, &ldquo;Rouet d&rsquo;Omphale,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
&ldquo;Phaeton,&rdquo; &ldquo;Danse Macabre,&rdquo; should be mentioned
as successful works of this class, but considerably
below Liszt&rsquo;s in genuine musical value. And
then, there are the orchestral impressions of Charles
Martin Loeffler, among which the symphonic poem,
&ldquo;La Mort de Tintagiles,&rdquo; is the most conspicuous. A
separate chapter is devoted to Richard Strauss.</p>
<p>Wagner is not supposed to have been a purely orchestral
composer. Theoretically, he wrote for the
theatre, and his orchestra was (again theoretically)
only part of a triple scheme of voice, action and instrumental
accompaniment. But put the instrumental
part of any of his great music-drama episodes on a concert
program, and with the first wave of the conductor&rsquo;s
baton and the first chord, you forget everything
else that has gone before!</p>

<h2>XII</h2>
<h3>RICHARD STRAUSS AND HIS MUSIC</h3>
</div>
<p>Richard Strauss&mdash;a new name to conjure
with in music! His banner is borne by a
band of enthusiasts like those who, many years
ago, carried the flag of Wagner to the front. &ldquo;Did not
Wagner put a full stop after the word &lsquo;music&rsquo;?&rdquo; some
will ask in surprise. &ldquo;Did he not strike the final note?
Are the &lsquo;Ring,&rsquo; &lsquo;Tristan&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parsifal&rsquo; not to be succeeded
by an eternal pause? Is there something still
to be achieved in music as in other arts and sciences?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something new certainly has been achieved by Richard
Strauss. It forms neither a continuation of Wagner
nor an opposition to Wagner. It has nothing to
do with Wagner, beyond that Strauss appropriates
whatever in the progression of art the latest master
has a right to take from his predecessors. Strauss
is, in fact, one of the most original and individual of
composers.</p>
<p>He has been a student, not a copyist, of Wagner.
Thus, where others who have sat at the feet of the
Bayreuth master have written poor imitations of Wagner,
and have therefore failed even to continue the
school, giving only feeble echoes of its great master,
Strauss has struck out for himself. With a mastery of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
every technical resource, acquired by deep and patient
study, he has given wholly new value and importance
to a form of art entirely different from the music-drama.
The music of the average modern Wagner
disciple sounds not like Wagner, but like Wagner and
water. Richard Strauss sounds like Richard Strauss.</p>
<p>One reason for this is that his art work, like Wagner&rsquo;s,
has an independent intellectual reason for being.
Let me not for one moment be understood as belittling
Wagner, in order to magnify Strauss. Wagner is the
one creator of an art-form who also seems destined
to remain its greatest exponent. Other creators of art-forms
have been mere pioneers, leaving to those who
have come after them the development and rounding
out of what with them were experiments. The story
of the sonata form may be said to have begun with
Philipp Emanuel Bach and to have been &ldquo;continued in
our next&rdquo; to Beethoven, with &ldquo;supplements&rdquo; ever since.
The music-drama had its tentative beginnings in &ldquo;The
Flying Dutchman,&rdquo; its consummation in &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo;
The years from 1843 to 1882 lay between, but the
music-drama was guided ever by the same hand, the
master hand of Richard Wagner. No, it would be
self-defeating folly to make Wagner appear less in
order to have Strauss appear more.</p>
<h4>Originator of the Tone Poem.</h4>
<p>Nor does Richard Strauss require such tactics. He has
made three excursions into music-drama and he may
make others. But his fame, at present, rests mainly upon
what he has accomplished as an instrumental composer,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span>
and in the self-created realm of the Tone Poem. Tone
poem is a new term in music. It stands for something
that outstrips the symphonic poem of Liszt, something
larger both in its boundaries and in its intellectual and
musical scope. Strauss does not limit himself by the
word symphonic. He leaves himself free to give full
range to his ideas. A composer of &ldquo;program music,&rdquo;
his works are so stupendous in scope that the word
symphonic would have hampered him. His &ldquo;Also
Sprach Zarathustra&rdquo; (&ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;) and
&ldquo;Ein Heldenleben&rdquo; (&ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life&rdquo;) are not symphonic
poems, but tone poems of enormous proportions.
These, his last two instrumental productions, together
with the growing familiarity of the musical public with
his beautiful and eloquent songs, established his reputation
in this country. To-day, a Strauss work on a
program means as much to the musically elect as a
Wagner work meant a quarter of a century ago. In
fact, to advanced musicians, to those who are not content
to rest upon what has been achieved, but are ready
to welcome further serious effort, Strauss&rsquo;s works form
the latest great utterance in music. Let me repeat verbatim
a conversation that occurred on a recent rainy
night, the date of an important concert.</p>
<p>He: &ldquo;Are you going to the concert to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She: (<i>Looking out and seeing that it still is raining
hard</i>) &ldquo;Do they play anything by Richard Strauss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He: &ldquo;Not to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She: &ldquo;Then I&rsquo;m not going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This woman could meet the most enthusiastic admirer
of Beethoven or Wagner on his own ground.
But when she heard &ldquo;Ein Heldenleben&rdquo; under Emil
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span>
Paur&rsquo;s baton at a concert of the New York Philharmonic
Society, she heard what she had been waiting
twenty years for&mdash;something new in music that also
was something great; something that was not merely
an imitation of what she had heard a hundred times
before, but something which pointed the way to untraveled
paths. It always is woman who throws the first
rose at the feet of genius.</p>
<h4>Not a Juggler with the Orchestra.</h4>
<p>One first looks at Richard Strauss in mere amazement
at the size of what he has produced. &ldquo;Thus
Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; lasts thirty-three minutes, &ldquo;A
Hero&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; forty-five&mdash;considerable lengths for orchestral
works. This initial sense of &ldquo;bigness,&rdquo; as
such, having worn off, one becomes aware of marvellous
tone combinations and orchestral effects. Listening
again, one discovers that these daring instrumental
combinations have not been entered into merely for the
sake of juggling with the orchestra, but because the
composer, being a modern of moderns, has the most
modern message in music to deliver, and, in order to
deliver it, has developed the modern orchestra to a state
of efficiency and versatility of tonal expression beyond
any of his predecessors. Richard Strauss scores, in
the most casual manner, an octave higher than Beethoven
dared go with the violins. Except in the
&ldquo;Egmont&rdquo; overture, Beethoven did not carry the violins
higher than F above the staff. What should have
been higher he wrote an octave lower. All the strings
in the Richard Strauss orchestra are scored correspondingly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
high. But this is not done as a mere fad.
What Richard Strauss accomplishes with the strings
is not merely queer or bizarre. What he seeks and
obtains is genuine original musical effects. Often
the highest register is used by him in a few of the
strings only, because, for certain polyphonic effects&mdash;the
weaving and interweaving of various themes&mdash;he
divides and subdivides all the strings into numerous
groups. For the same reason, he has regularly added
four or five hitherto rarely used instruments to the
woodwind and scores, regularly, for eight horns, besides
employing from four to five trumpets.</p>
<p>While he has increased the technical difficulties of
every instrument, what he requires of them is not impossible.
He does, indeed, call for first-rate artists in
his orchestra; but so did Wagner as compared with
Beethoven. He knows every instrument thoroughly,
for he has taken lessons on all; and, therefore, when
he is striving for new instrumental effects he is not
putting problems which cannot be legitimately solved.
His &ldquo;Till Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s Merry Pranks&rdquo; makes, possibly,
the greatest demand of all his works on an
orchestra. But, if properly played, it is one of the
most bizarre and amusing scherzos in the repertoire.
In his &ldquo;Don Quixote,&rdquo; he has gone outside the list of
orchestral instruments; and in the scene where <i>Don
Quixote</i> has his tilt with the windmill, he has introduced
a regular theatrical wind-machine. And why
not? The effect to be produced justifies the means.
There is an <i>à capella</i> chorus by Strauss for sixteen
voices. These are not divided into two double quartets,
or into four quartets, but the composition actually
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
is scored in sixteen parts. He shrinks from no
musical problem.</p>
<h4>Not Mere Bulk and Noise.</h4>
<p>When &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; was produced in New York
it was given at a public rehearsal and concert of the
Philharmonic. It made such a profound impression&mdash;it
was recognized as music, not as mere bulk and noise&mdash;that
it had to be repeated at a following public rehearsal
and concert, thus having the honor of four consecutive
performances by the same society in one season.
Previous performances of Strauss&rsquo;s works,
mainly by the Chicago Orchestra, under Thomas, and
the Boston Symphony Orchestra, had begun to direct
public attention to this composer. But the &ldquo;Heldenleben&rdquo;
performances by the Philharmonic created something
of a sensation. They made the &ldquo;hit&rdquo; to which the
public unconsciously had been working up for several
seasons. Large as are the dimensions of &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s
Life,&rdquo; Richard Strauss had chosen a subject that made
a very direct appeal. Despite its wealth of polyphony
and theme combination, the score told, without a word
of synopsis, a clear intelligible story of a hero&rsquo;s material
victory, followed by a greater moral one. It
placed the public on a human, familiar footing with
a composer whom previously they had regarded with
more awe than interest. Here was music interesting
as mere music, but all the more interesting because it
had an intellectual message to convey.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span></div>
<h4>Life and Truth.</h4>
<p>What is the difference between classical and modern
music? Write a chapter or a book on it, and the difference
still remains just this: Classical music is the
expression of beauty; modern music the expression of
life and truth. Modern music seems entering upon a
new era with Strauss, which does not necessarily exclude
beauty. It is beginning to illustrate itself, so to
speak, like the author-artist who can both write and
draw. To-day, music not only expresses truth, but
represents it pictorially. How long will the time be
in coming when a composer will wave his bâton, the
orchestra strike a chord&mdash;and we be not only listeners
but also beholders, hearing the chord, and seeing at
the same time its image floating above the orchestra?</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;Melomaniacs,&rdquo; the most remarkable collection
of musical stories I have read, Mr. Huneker has
a tale called &ldquo;A Piper of Dreams,&rdquo; the most advanced
piece of musical fiction I know of. This piper of
dreams produces music which is <em>seen</em>. &ldquo;Do you know
why you like it?&rdquo; Mr. Huneker asked me, when I told
him how intensely I admired the story. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;the hero of the story is a Richard
Strauss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course, this brilliantly written story was a daring
incursion into a seemingly impossible future. Yet it
points a tendency. When shall we have music that
can be seen? Considering how closely related are the
laws of acoustics and optics, is a &ldquo;Piper of Dreams&rdquo;
so visionary? Who knows but that the music of the
future may be visible sound&mdash;the work of a piper of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span>
dreams? Sometimes, when listening to Strauss, I think
Mr. Huneker&rsquo;s <i>Piper</i> is tuning up.</p>
<p>Richard Strauss&rsquo;s tone poems are large in plan. In
fact they are colossal. They show him to be a man
of great intellectual activity, as well as an inspired
composer. The latter, of course, is the test by which
a musical work stands or falls. No matter how intellectually
it is planned, if it is inadequate musically
it fails. But if it is musically inspired, it gains vastly
in effect when it rests on a brain basis.</p>
<h4>Literally Tone Dramas.</h4>
<p>That Richard Strauss is the most significant figure
in the musical world to-day seems to me too patent to
admit of discussion. The only question to be considered
is, how has he become so? The question is best
answered by showing what a Richard Strauss tone
poem is. Take &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; and &ldquo;A
Hero&rsquo;s Life.&rdquo; Without going into an elaborate discussion
I must insist that, to consider Richard Strauss
as in any way a development from Berlioz or Liszt,
shows a deplorable unfamiliarity with his works. Berlioz
wrote program music. Liszt wrote program
music. Richard Strauss writes program music. But
this point of resemblance is wholly superficial. Berlioz
admittedly strove to adhere to the orthodox symphonic
form. Liszt aptly named his own productions &ldquo;symphonic
poems.&rdquo; They are much freer in form than
Berlioz&rsquo;s, and possibly pointed the way to the Richard
Strauss tone poem. But when we examine the musical
kernel, the difference at once is apparent. Polyphony,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
that is, the simultaneous interweaving of many
themes, was foreign to Berlioz and Liszt. Their style
is mainly homophonic. Richard Strauss is a polyphonic
composer second not even to Wagner, whose
system of leading motives in his music-dramas made
his scores such marvellous polyphonic structures. Such,
too, are the scores of Richard Strauss&rsquo;s tone poems.
None but a master of polyphony could have attempted
to express in music what Richard Strauss has expressed.
For are not his tone poems literally tone
dramas?</p>
<p>It was like a man of great intellectual activity, such
as Richard Strauss is, to select for musical illustration
the Faust of modern literature&mdash;Nietzsche&rsquo;s &ldquo;Zarathustra.&rdquo;
The composer became interested in Nietzsche&rsquo;s
works in 1892, when he was writing his music-drama,
&ldquo;Guntram.&rdquo; The full fruition of his study of this
philosopher&rsquo;s works is &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra.&rdquo; But
this is not an attempt to set Nietzsche to music, not
an effort to express a system of philosophy through
sound. It is rather the musical portrayal of a quest&mdash;a
being longing to solve the problems of life, finding
at the end of his varied pilgrimage that which he
had left at the beginning, Nature deep and inscrutable.</p>
<p>Musically, the great <i>fortissimo</i> outburst in C major,
which, at the beginning of the work, greets the seeker
on the mountain-top with the glories of the sunrise, is
the symbol of Nature. The seeker descends the mountain.
He pursues the quest amid many surroundings,
among all sorts and conditions of men. He experiences
joy, passion, remorse. In wisdom, perchance,
lies the final solution of the problem of life. But the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
emptiness of &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo; is depicted by the composer
with the keenest satire in a learned, yet dry, five-part
fugue. The seeker&rsquo;s varied experiences form as many
divisions of the tone poem. There is even a waltz
theme. Unending joy! Therein he may reach the
end of his quest.</p>
<p>But hark! a sombre strophe, followed twelve times
by the even fainter stroke of a bell! Then a theme
winging its flight on the highest register of modern
instrumentation, until it seems to rise over the orchestra
and vanish into thin air. It is the soul of the
seeker, his earthly quest ended; while the theme which
greeted him at sunrise on the mountain-top resounds
in the orchestral depths, the symbol of Nature, still
mysterious, still inscrutable.</p>
<h4>An Intellectual Force in Music.</h4>
<p>Even this brief synopsis suggests that &ldquo;Zarathustra&rdquo;
is planned on a large scale. It presupposes an intellectual
grasp of the subject on the composer&rsquo;s part. In
its choice, in the selection and rejection of details and
in outlining his scheme, Richard Strauss shows that
he has thoroughly assimilated Nietzsche. But, at a certain
point, the musician in Richard Strauss asserts
himself above the litterateur. &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;
was not intended for a preachment, save indirectly.
From what occurs during that vain quest, from
the last deep mysterious chord of the Nature theme,
let the listener draw his own conclusion. In the last
analysis, &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo; is not a philosophical
treatise, but a tone poem. In the last analysis,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
Richard Strauss is not a philosopher, but a musician.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; is another work of large plan.
Like &ldquo;Zarathustra,&rdquo; it derives its importance as an
art-work from its eloquence as a musical composition.
With a musical work, no matter how intellectual
or dramatic its foundation, its test ever will
be its value as pure music. Richard Wagner&rsquo;s theories
would have fallen like a house of cards, had not his
music been eloquent and beautiful. But as his music
gained wonderfully in added eloquence and beauty by
induction from its intellectual content, so does
Strauss&rsquo;s. The fact is, music is music, while philosophies
come and go. Yesterday it was Schopenhauer;
to-day it is Nietzsche; to-morrow it will be another.
Doubtless, Wagner thought his &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; was Schopenhauer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Negation of the Will to Live&rdquo; set to music.
Possibly, Richard Strauss thought Nietzsche looked out
between the bars of &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra.&rdquo; In
point of fact, neither Wagner nor Richard Strauss incorporated
their favorite philosophers in their music.
Wagner may have derived his inspiration from his
reading of Schopenhauer, and Richard Strauss from
Nietzsche, for one mind inspires another. But the
real result, both in Wagner and Strauss, was great
music.</p>
<p>This is made clear by Strauss&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life.&rdquo;
Like &ldquo;Zarathustra,&rdquo; it would be effective as music without
a line of programmatic explanation. The latter
simply adds to its effectiveness by giving it the further
interest of &ldquo;fiction&rdquo; and ethical import. In &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s
Life&rdquo; we hear (and <em>see</em>, if you like) the hero himself,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
his jealous adversaries, the woman whose love
consoles him, the battle in which he wins his greatest
worldly triumph, his mission of peace, the world&rsquo;s
indifference and the final flight of his soul toward the
empyrean. All this is depicted musically with the
greatest eloquence. The battlefield scene is a stupendous
massing of orchestral forces. On the other hand,
the amorous episode, entitled &ldquo;The Hero&rsquo;s Helpmate,&rdquo;
is impassioned and charming.</p>
<p>In the world&rsquo;s indifference to the hero&rsquo;s mission of
peace, there is little doubt that Strauss was indulging
in a retrospect of his own struggles for recognition.
For here are heard numerous reminiscences of his earlier
works&mdash;his tone poems, &ldquo;Don Juan,&rdquo; &ldquo;Death and
Transfiguration,&rdquo; &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; &ldquo;Till Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s
Merry Pranks,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra,&rdquo; &ldquo;Don
Quixote&rdquo;; his music-drama, &ldquo;Guntram&rdquo;; and his song,
&ldquo;Dream During Twilight.&rdquo; These reminiscences give
&ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; the same autobiographical interest
as attaches to Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Meistersinger.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Tribute to Wagner.</h4>
<p>Strauss pays a tribute to Wagner in the one-act
opera, &ldquo;Feuersnot&rdquo; (&ldquo;Fire Famine&rdquo;). According to
the old legend on which this <i>Sing-gedicht</i> (song-poem)
is founded, a young maiden has offended her lover.
But the lover being a magician, casts a spell over the
town, causing the extinction of all fire, bringing cold
and darkness upon the entire place, until the maiden
relents and smiles again upon him, when the spell is
lifted and the fires once more burn brightly. The
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
young lover, <i>Kunrad</i>, in rebuking the people of the
city, says:</p>
<table summary=''><tr><td>
<p class='cg'>&ldquo;In this house which to-day I destroy,<br />
Once lodged Richard the Master.<br />
Disgracefully did ye expel him<br />
In envy and baseness,&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Accompanying these lines, Strauss introduces themes
from Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung.&rdquo; Undoubtedly
&ldquo;Richard the Master,&rdquo; in the above lines, is Richard
Wagner.</p>
<p>While Mr. Paur was not the first orchestral leader
who has played Strauss&rsquo;s music in this country, he may
justly be regarded as Strauss&rsquo;s prophet in New York
at least. Not only do we owe to him the performances
of &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life,&rdquo; which definitely &ldquo;created&rdquo; Strauss
here, but it was he who brought forward &ldquo;Thus Spake
Zarathustra,&rdquo; when he was conductor of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra. As long ago as 1889, when
Mr. Paur was conductor at Mannheim, he invited
Strauss to direct his symphony in F minor there.
Strauss accepted and also brought with him his just
completed &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; asking to be allowed to try it
over with the orchestra, as he wanted to hear it&mdash;a
request which was readily granted. Afterward, at
Mr. Paur&rsquo;s house, Strauss&rsquo;s piano quartet was played,
with the composer himself at the piano and Mr. Paur
at the violin. It is not surprising that when Mr. Paur
came over here as the conductor of the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, he championed Richard Strauss&rsquo;s
work, continued to do so after he became conductor
of the New York Philharmonic Society, and probably
still does as conductor of the Pittsburg Orchestra.</p>
<p>Strauss has become such an important figure in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
world of music that it is interesting to note what has
been done to bring his work before the American public.
Theodore Thomas, with the artistic liberality
which he has always displayed toward every serious
effort in music, produced Strauss&rsquo;s symphony in F
minor, which bears date 1883, as early as December
13, 1884, with the New York Philharmonic Society.
It was the first performance of this work anywhere.
Strauss was not, however, heard again at the concerts
of this organization until January, 1892, when Seidl
brought out &ldquo;Death and Transfiguration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he became conductor of the Chicago Orchestra,
Thomas gave many performances of Richard Strauss&rsquo;s
works&mdash;in 1895, the prelude to &ldquo;Guntram,&rdquo; &ldquo;Death
and Transfiguration&rdquo; and &ldquo;Till Eulenspiegel&rsquo;s Merry
Pranks&rdquo;; in 1897, &ldquo;Don Juan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra&rdquo;;
in 1899, &ldquo;Don Quixote&rdquo; and the symphonic
fantasia, &ldquo;Italy&rdquo;; in 1900, &ldquo;A Hero&rsquo;s Life&rdquo; (the first
performance in this country) and the &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; for
wind instruments; in 1902, &ldquo;Macbeth&rdquo; (first performance
in this country) and the &ldquo;Feuersnot&rdquo; fragment.
Several of these works, besides those noted, had their
first performance in this country by the Chicago Orchestra,
and several have had repeated performances.</p>
<p>The Boston Symphony Orchestra also has a fine
record as regards the performance of Richard Strauss&rsquo;s
works. Nikisch, Paur, and Gericke are the conductors
under whom these performances have been given.
Several of the works have been played repeatedly not
only in Boston, but in other cities where this famous
orchestra gives concerts.</p>

<h4>Richard Straussiana.</h4>
<p>As data regarding Strauss&rsquo;s life, at the disposal of
English readers, are both scant and scattered, it may
not be amiss to tell here something of his career. He
was born on June 11, 1864, in Munich, where his
father, Franz Strauss, played the French-horn in the
Royal Orchestra, and was noted for his remarkable
proficiency on the instrument. The elder Strauss lived
long enough to watch with pride his son&rsquo;s growing
fame. Richard began to play the piano when he was
four years old. At the age of six he heard some children
singing around a Christmas tree. &ldquo;I can compose
something like that,&rdquo; he said, and he produced
unaided a three-part song. When he went to school,
his mother by chance put covers of music paper on
his books. As a result, he occupied much of his time
composing on this paper, and during a French lesson
sketched out the scherzo of a string quartet which
has been published as his Opus 2. While he was still
at school, he composed a symphony in D minor. This
was played by the Royal Orchestra under Levi. When,
in response to calls for the composer, Richard came
out, some one in the audience asked: &ldquo;What has that
boy to do with the symphony?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s only the
composer,&rdquo; was the reply. The year before (1880),
the Royal Opera prima donna, Meysenheim, had publicly
sung three of his songs.</p>
<p>During his advanced school years, his piano lessons
continued, he received lessons in the violin, and went
through a severe course in composition with the Royal
Kapellmeister, Meyer. In 1882, he attended the University
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
of Munich. His &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; for wind instruments,
composed at this time, attracted the attention
of Hans von Bülow, under whom he studied for a while
at Raff&rsquo;s conservatory in Frankfort. Bülow invited
him to Meiningen as co-director of the orchestra, and
when in November, 1885, Bülow resigned as conductor,
Strauss became his successor, remaining there, however,
only till April, 1886. His symphonic fantasia,
&ldquo;Italy,&rdquo; had its origin through a trip to Rome and
Naples during this year. In August, 1886, he was
appointed assistant conductor to Levi and Fischer at
the Munich Opera, where he remained until July, 1889,
when he became conductor at Weimar. In 1892, he
almost died from an attack of pneumonia, and on his
recovery took a long trip through Greece, Egypt and
Sicily. It was on this tour that he wrote and composed
&ldquo;Guntram,&rdquo; which was brought out at Weimar
in May, 1894. After the first performance, he announced
his engagement to the singer of <i>Freihild</i> in
&ldquo;Guntram,&rdquo; Pauline de Ahna, the daughter of a Bavarian
general. The same year he returned to Munich
as conductor, remaining there until 1899, when he became
one of the conductors at the Berlin Opera, which
position he still holds. He is one of the &ldquo;star&rdquo; conductors
of Europe, receiving invitations to conduct
concerts in many cities, including Brussels, Moscow,
Amsterdam, Barcelona, Madrid, London and Paris;
and his American tour was a memorable one. He is
a man of untiring industry. It is said that he worked
no less than half a year on &ldquo;Thus Spake Zarathustra,&rdquo;
and that the writing of his scores is a model of beauty.</p>
<p>Strauss occupies a commanding position in the world
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
of music. He has achieved it through a remarkable
combination of musical technique and inspiration
coupled with rare industry. His ideals are of the highest.
His intellectual activity is great. He seems a
man of calm and noble poise, of broad horizon. It
would be presumption to speak of &ldquo;expectations&rdquo; as to
one who has accomplished so much. For the great
achievements already to his credit, and among these
&ldquo;Salome&rdquo; surely must be included, are the best promise
for the future.</p>

<h2>XIII</h2>
<h3>A NOTE ON CHAMBER MUSIC</h3>
</div>
<p>Lovers of chamber music form an extremely
refined and cultured class, and, like all highly
refined and cultured people, are very conservative.
They are the purists among music-lovers, the
last people who would care to see the classical forms
abandoned, and who would be disturbed, not to say
shocked, by any great departure from the sonata form.
For the string quartet is to chamber music what the
symphony is to orchestra and the sonata to the pianoforte&mdash;is,
in fact, a sonata for two violins, viola and
violoncello, just as the symphony is a sonata for orchestra.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, a pianoforte solo is more effective in
a large hall than a string quartet, although the latter
employs four times as many instruments; and the same
is true of those pieces of chamber music in which
the pianoforte is used, such as sonatas for pianoforte
and violin or violoncello, pianoforte trios, quartets,
quintets, and so on. A fine soloist on the pianoforte
will be more at home in a large auditorium like Carnegie
Hall or even the Metropolitan Opera House than
would a string quartet or any other combination of
chamber-music players. Paderewski plays in Carnegie
Hall, and, I am sure, would be equally effective in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span>
Opera House. But an organization of chamber-music
players would be lost in either place. The Kneisel
Quartet plays in New York in Mendelssohn Hall, a
small auditorium which is just about correctly proportioned
for music of this kind.</p>
<p>Indeed, compared with the opera, the orchestra and
even with the pianoforte, chamber music requires a
setting like a jewel. For just as its devotees are the
purists among music-lovers, so chamber music itself
is something very &ldquo;precious.&rdquo; It certainly is a most
charming and intimate form of musical entertainment
and the constituency of a well-established string quartet
inevitably consists of the musical élite.</p>
<p>The same opinions that have been expressed regarding
the sonatas and the symphonies of the great composers
apply in a general way to their chamber music.
Haydn&rsquo;s is naive; Mozart&rsquo;s more emotional in expression;
Beethoven&rsquo;s, among that of classical composers,
the most dramatic. In fact, Beethoven&rsquo;s last quartets,
in which the instruments are employed quite independently
and in which rôles practically of equal importance
are assigned to each, are regarded by Richard
Strauss as having given the cue to Wagner for his
polyphonic treatment of the orchestra, and Wagner
himself spoke of them as works through which &ldquo;Music
first raised herself to an equal height with the poetry
and painting of the greatest periods of the past.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, there are many who hold that in his
last quartets Beethoven sought to accomplish more than
can be expressed with four stringed instruments, and
prefer his earlier works of this class, like the three
&ldquo;Rasumovski&rdquo; quartets, Opus 59, dedicated by the composer
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226' name='page_226'></a>226</span>
to Count Rasumovski, who maintained a private
string quartet in which he played second violin, the
others being professionals.</p>
<p>Schubert&rsquo;s most famous quartet is the one in D minor
with the lovely slow movement, a theme with
variations, the theme being his own song, &ldquo;Death and
the Maiden.&rdquo; One of the greatest works in the whole
range of chamber music is his string quintet with two
violoncellos. His pianoforte trios also are noble contributions
to this branch of musical art. &ldquo;One glance
at this trio,&rdquo; writes Schumann of the Schubert trio
in B flat major, &ldquo;and all the wretchedness of existence
is put to flight and the world seems young
again.... Many and beautiful as are the
things Time brings forth, it will be long ere it produces
another Schubert.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s chamber music is as polished, affable
and gentlemanly as most of his other productions, and
rapidly falling into the same state of unlamented desuetude.
Schumann has given us his lovely pianoforte
quintet in E flat. Brahms has contributed much
that is noteworthy to chamber music, and, as a rule,
it is less complex and more intelligently scored than
his orchestral music. Dvorak in his E flat major quartet
(Opus 51) introduces as the second movement a
Dumka or Bohemian elegy, one of the most exquisite
of his compositions. Fascinating in his national musical
tints, he was genius enough for his music to be
universal in its expression; and he who used the folksongs
of his native Bohemia so skillfully was no less
artistic in the results he accomplished when, during
his residence in New York, he wrote his string quartet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
in F (Opus 96) on Negro themes. Tschaikowsky and
neo-Russians like Arensky, and the Frenchmen, César
Franck, Saint-Saëns, d&rsquo;Indy and Debussy, are some
of the modern names that figure on chamber-music
programs.</p>

<h2>XIV</h2>
<h3>SONGS AND SONG COMPOSERS</h3>
</div>
<p>Songs either are strophic or &ldquo;<i>durchcomponirt</i>&rdquo;
(composed through). In the strophic song the
melody and accompaniment are repeated unchanged
through each stanza or strophe of the poem;
while, when a song is composed through, the music,
although the principal melody may be repeated more
than once, is subjected to changes in accordance with
the moods of the poem.</p>
<p>Schubert is the first song composer who requires serious
consideration. While not strictly the originator
of the <i>Lied</i>, he is universally acknowledged to be the
first great song composer and to have lifted song to
its proper place of importance in music. Gluck set
Klopfstock&rsquo;s odes to music; Haydn as a song writer is
remembered by &ldquo;Liebes Mädchen hör&rsquo; mir Zu&rdquo;; Mozart
by &ldquo;Das Veilchen&rdquo;; and Beethoven by &ldquo;Adelaide&rdquo;
and one or two other songs. Before Schubert&rsquo;s day this
form of composition was regarded as something rather
trivial and beneath the dignity of genius. But Haydn,
Mozart and Beethoven at least did one thing through
which they may possibly have contributed to the development
of song-writing. By their freer writing for
the pianoforte they prepared the way for the Schubert
accompaniments.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>Where Schubert got his musical genius from is a
mystery. His father was a schoolmaster, whose first
wife, Schubert&rsquo;s mother, was a cook. The couple had
fourteen children and an income of $175. If this income
is somewhat disproportionate to the size of the
family, it yet is fortunate that they had fourteen children
instead of only thirteen. Otherwise there would
have been one great name less in musical history, for
Schubert was the fourteenth.</p>
<p>He was born in Vienna in January, 1797. His
thirty-one years&mdash;for this genius who so enriched
music lived to be only thirty-one&mdash;were passed in poverty.
His father was wretchedly poor, and his own
works, when they could be disposed of at all to publishers,
were sold at beggarly prices. Now they are
universally recognized as masterpieces and are worth
many times their weight in gold.</p>
<h4>Too Poor to Buy Music Paper.</h4>
<p>Shortly before he was twelve years old, Schubert,
who had been singing soprano solos and playing violin
in the parish choir, was sent to the so-called Convict,
the Imperial school for training boys for the Court
chapel. During his five years there his progress was
so rapid that even before he was fourteen years old he
was occasionally asked to substitute for the conductor
of the school orchestra. Life, however, was hard. He
had no money with which to buy even a few luxuries
in the way of food to eke out the wretched fare of
the Convict, nor music paper. Had it not been for the
kindness of a fellow pupil and friend, named Spaun, he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
would not have been able to write down and work out
his ideas.</p>
<p>When his voice changed, the straitened family circumstances
obliged him to become an assistant in his
father&rsquo;s school. He was able to bear poverty with
patience, but not the drudgery of teaching, and he is
said often to have lost his temper with the boys. Altogether,
he taught for three years, 1815 to 1818; and
while his work was most distasteful to him, his genius
was so spontaneous that during his three years he composed
many songs, among them his immortal &ldquo;Erlking.&rdquo;
Finally a university student, Franz von Schober,
who, having heard some of Schubert&rsquo;s songs, had
become an enthusiastic admirer of the composer, offered
him one of his rooms as a lodging, whereupon Schubert,
straightway accepting the offer, gave up teaching
and from that time to the end of his brief life led a
Bohemian existence with a clique of friends of varied
accomplishments. In this circle he was known as
&ldquo;Canevas,&rdquo; because whenever some new person joined
it, his first question regarding the newcomer was
&ldquo;<i>Kann er wass?</i>&rdquo; (Can he do anything?)</p>
<p>Outside a small circle of acquaintances, Schubert remained
practically unknown until he made the acquaintance
of Johann Michael Vogl, an opera singer,
to whom his devoted friend, Von Schober, introduced
him. Vogl was somewhat reserved in his opinion of
the songs which he tried over with Schubert at their
first meeting, but they made an impression. He followed
up the acquaintance and became the first professional
interpreter of Schubert&rsquo;s lyrics. &ldquo;The manner
in which Vogl sings and I accompany,&rdquo; wrote Schubert
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
to his brother Ferdinand, &ldquo;so that we appear like
<em>one</em> on such occasions, is something new and unheard
of to our listeners.&rdquo; Publishers, however, held aloof.
Five years after the &ldquo;Erlking&rdquo; was composed, several
of them refused to print it, although Schubert offered
to forego royalties on it. Finally, some of Schubert&rsquo;s
friends had the song published at their own expense,
and its success led to the issuing of eleven other songs,
Schubert unwisely accepting eight hundred florins in
lieu of royalty on these and the &ldquo;Erlking.&rdquo; Yet from
one of these songs alone, &ldquo;The Wanderer,&rdquo; the publishers
received twenty-seven thousand florins between
the years 1822 and 1861.</p>
<h4>How the &ldquo;Erlking&rdquo; was Composed.</h4>
<p>Schubert being the greatest of song composers, and
the &ldquo;Erlking&rdquo; his greatest song, the circumstances under
which it was written are of especial interest. His
friend Spaun, the same who provided him with music
paper at the Convict, relates that one afternoon toward
the close of the year 1815 he went with the poet Mayrhofer
to visit Schubert. They found the composer all
aglow, reading the &ldquo;Erlking&rdquo; aloud to himself. He
walked up and down the room several times, book in
hand, then suddenly sat down and as fast as his pen
could travel put the music on paper. Having no piano,
the three men hurried over to the Convict, where the
&ldquo;Erlking&rdquo; was sung the same evening and received
with enthusiasm. The old Court organist, Ruziczka,
afterward played it over himself without the voice,
and when some of those present objected to the dissonance
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
which occurs three times in the course of the
composition and depicts the child&rsquo;s terror of the <i>Erlking</i>,
the old organist struck these chords and explained
how perfectly they reflected the spirit of the
poem and how felicitously they were worked out in
their musical resolution.</p>
<p>Schubert&rsquo;s song is almost Wagnerian in its descriptive
and dramatic quality. The coaxing voice of the
<i>Erlking</i>, the terror of the child, the efforts of the father
to allay his boy&rsquo;s fears, each has its characteristic expression,
which yet is different from the narrative portions
of the poem, while in the accompaniment the horse
gallops along. Schubert was but eighteen years old
when he set this ballad of Goethe&rsquo;s to music; yet there
is no more thrilling climax to be found in all song
literature than those dissonances which I have mentioned
and which with each repeat rise to a higher
interval and become each time more shrill with terror.
Whoever has heard Lilli Lehmann sing this song
should be able to appreciate its real greatness, as
Goethe, who had remained utterly indifferent to Schubert&rsquo;s
music, did when the &ldquo;Erlking&rdquo; was sung to him
by Frau Schroeder-Devrient, to whom he exclaimed:
&ldquo;Thank you a thousand times for this great artistic
achievement. When I heard this song before I did not
like it at all, but sung in your way it becomes a true
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Finck on Schubert.</h4>
<p>More than six hundred songs by Schubert have been
published, and when we remember that he wrote symphonies,
sonatas, shorter pianoforte pieces, chamber
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
music and operas, the fertility of his brief life is astounding.
The rapidity with which he composed, however,
was not due to carelessness, but to the spontaneity
of his genius and the fact that he loved to compose.
&ldquo;He composed as a bird sings in the spring, or as a
well gushes from a mountain-side, simply because he
could not help it,&rdquo; says Mr. Finck, in his &ldquo;Songs and
Song Writers.&rdquo; We have it on the authority of Schubert&rsquo;s
friend, Spaun, that when he went to bed he kept
his spectacles on, so that when he woke up he could
go right to the table and compose without wasting time
looking for his glasses. In the two years 1815-16 he
wrote no less than two hundred and fifty-four songs.
Six of the songs in the &ldquo;Winterreise&rdquo; cycle were composed
in one morning, and he had eight songs to his
credit in a single day. The charming &ldquo;Hark, Hark,
the Lark&rdquo; was written at a tavern where he chanced
to see the poem in a book the leaves of which he was
slowly turning over. &ldquo;If I only had some music
paper!&rdquo; he exclaimed, whereupon one of his friends
promptly ruled lines on the back of his <i>Speise Karte</i>,
and Schubert, with the varied noises of the tavern going
on about him, jotted down the song then and there.</p>
<p>Of course, it is impossible to touch on all the aspects
of such a genius as his. In his songs clear and beautiful
melody is, as a rule, combined with a descriptive
accompaniment. Sometimes the description is given
by means of only a few chords, like the preluding ones
in &ldquo;Am Meer.&rdquo; At other times the description runs
through the entire accompaniment, like the waves that
flash and dance around the melody of &ldquo;Auf dem Wasser
zu Singen&rdquo;; the galloping horse in the &ldquo;Erlking&rdquo;;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
the veiled mist that seems to hang over the scenes in the
wonderfully dramatic poem, &ldquo;Die Stadt&rdquo;; the flutter
of the bird in &ldquo;Hark, Hark, the Lark&rdquo;; the brook that
flows like a leitmotif through the &ldquo;Maid of the Mill&rdquo;
cycle&mdash;these are a few of the examples that with Schubert
could be cited by the dozen.</p>
<p>And the range of his work&mdash;here again space forbids
the multiplication of examples. It extends from
the naive &ldquo;Haiden Röslein&rdquo; to the tragic &ldquo;Doppelgänger&rdquo;;
from the whispering foliage of the &ldquo;Linden
Tree&rdquo; to the pathetic drone of the &ldquo;Hurdy-Gurdy
Man&rdquo;; from the &ldquo;Serenade&rdquo; to &ldquo;Todt und das Mädchen.&rdquo;
Schubert is the greatest genius among song
composers. Compare the growing reputation of him
who of all musicians was perhaps the most neglected
during his life, with that of Mendelssohn, the most
fêted of composers, but now rapidly dropping to the
position of a minor tone poet, and who, although he
wrote eighty-three songs, is as a song writer remembered
outside of Germany by barely more than one
<i>Lied</i>, the familiar &ldquo;On the Wings of Song.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Schumann&rsquo;s Individuality.</h4>
<p>In Schumann&rsquo;s songs the piano part is more closely
knit and interwoven with the vocal melody than with
Schubert&rsquo;s, and, as a result, the voice does not stand out
so clearly. While his songs are not what they have been
called by a German critic, &ldquo;pianoforte pieces with accidental
vocal accompaniments,&rdquo; at times, in his vocal compositions,
the pianoforte gains too great an ascendancy
over the voice. If asked to draw a distinction between
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span>
Schubert and Schumann, I should say that there is a
twofold interest in most of Schubert&rsquo;s songs. He reproduces
the feeling of the poem in his vocal melody;
then, if the poem contains a descriptive suggestion, he
produces that phase of it in his accompaniment, without,
however, allowing the pianoforte part to encroach
on the vocal melody. The melody gives the feeling,
the accompaniment the description or mood picture.
Schumann, on the other hand, rarely is descriptive.
Nearly always he produces a mood picture in tone,
but requires both voice and pianoforte to effect his purpose.
As this, however, is Schumann&rsquo;s method of composition,
and as it is better that each composer should
leave the seal of his individuality on everything he
does, and not be an imitator, it is not cause for regret
that while Schubert is Schubert, Schumann is Schumann.</p>
<p>The proportion of fine songs among the two hundred
and forty-five composed by Schumann is, however,
much smaller than in the heritage left us by Schubert;
and while Schubert, from the time he wrote his first
great vocal compositions, added many equally great
ones every year, Schumann&rsquo;s songs, on the whole, show
a decided falling off after he had wooed and won Clara
Wieck. It was during his courtship that he produced
his best songs. Separated from her by the command
of her stern father, he made love to her in music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am now writing nothing but songs, great and
small,&rdquo; we find him saying in a letter to a friend in
the summer of 1840. &ldquo;Hardly can I tell you how delicious
it is to write for voice instead of for instruments,
and what a turmoil and tumult I feel within
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
me when I sit down to it.&rdquo; While he was composing
his song cycle, &ldquo;Die Myrthen,&rdquo; he wrote to Clara:
&ldquo;Since yesterday morning I have written twenty-seven
pages of music, all new, concerning which the best I
can tell you is that I laughed and wept for joy while
composing them.&rdquo; A month later he writes her, in
sending her his first printed songs: &ldquo;When I composed
them my soul was within yours; without such
a love, indeed, no one could write such music&mdash;and this
I intend as a special compliment.&rdquo; ... &ldquo;I could
sing myself to death, like a nightingale,&rdquo; he writes to
her again, on May 15th. Never was there such a
musical wooing, and those who wish to participate in
it can do so by singing or listening to such songs as
&ldquo;Dedication,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Almond Tree,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lotos Flower,&rdquo;
&ldquo;In the Forest&rdquo; (Waldesgespräch), &ldquo;Spring
Night,&rdquo; &ldquo;He, the Noblest of the Noble,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thou Ring
upon My Finger,&rdquo; &ldquo;&rsquo;Twas in the Lovely Month of
May,&rdquo; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;er My Tears Are Falling,&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Not
Complain,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nightly in My Dreaming.&rdquo; Among
his songs not inspired by love should be mentioned the
&ldquo;Two Grenadiers,&rdquo; which Plançon sings so inimitably.</p>
<h4>Phases of Franz&rsquo;s Genius.</h4>
<p>Robert Franz (1815-1892) had his life embittered
by neglect and physical ills. His family name originally
was Knauth, his father having been Christoph
Knauth. But in order to distinguish him from his
brother, who was engaged in the same business, he
was addressed as Christoph Franz, a name which he
subsequently had legalized. Yet critics insisted that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Robert Franz was a pseudonym which the composer
had adopted from vanity in order to indicate that he
was as great as <em>Robert</em> Schumann and <em>Franz</em> Schubert
put together.</p>
<p>Franz was strongly influenced by Bach and Händel,
many of whose scores he supplied with what are known
as &ldquo;additional accompaniments,&rdquo; filling out gaps which
these composers left in their scores according to the
custom of their day. His songs show this influence in
their polyphony, and the German critic, Ambros, said
that Franz&rsquo;s song, &ldquo;Der Schwere Abend,&rdquo; looked as if
Bach had sat down and composed a Franz song out
of thanks for all that Franz was to do for him through
his additional accompaniments. Besides their polyphony
derived from Bach, Franz&rsquo;s songs are interesting
for their modulations, which are employed not simply
for the sake of showing cleverness or originality, but
for their appropriateness in expressing the mood of the
poem. He also was extremely careful in regard to
the choice of key and decidedly objected to transpositions
of his songs, in order to make them singable for
higher or lower voices than could use the original key.
&ldquo;When I am dead,&rdquo; he wrote to his publisher, &ldquo;I cannot
prevent these transpositions, but so long as I am
alive I shall fight them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Franz did not endeavor to reproduce visible things
in his pianoforte parts, and the voice in his songs often
is declamatory, merging into melody only in the more
deeply emotional passages. He is a reflective rather
than a dramatic composer, disliked opera, and himself
said that any one who had penetrated deeply into his
songs well knew that the dramatic element was not to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
be found in them, nor was it intended to be. Composers,
however, have many theories regarding their
music which, in practice, come to naught; and whether
Franz thought his songs dramatic or not, the fact remains
that when Lilli Lehmann sang his &ldquo;Im Herbst&rdquo;
it was as thrillingly dramatic as anything could be.</p>
<h4>Self-Critical.</h4>
<p>Franz was extremely self-critical. He kept his productions
in his desk for years, working over them again
and again, until in many cases the song in its final
shape bore slight resemblance to what it had been at
first. He declared his Opus 1 to be no worse than his
latest work, because it had been composed with equal
care and had had the benefit of his ripening judgment
and experience. He admired Wagner and dedicated
one of his song volumes to him; but when some critics
fancied that they discovered Wagnerian traits in several
songs in his last collection, Op. 51-52, he was
able to prove that these very songs were among the
first he had written, and were published so late in
his career simply because he had kept them back for
revision.</p>
<p>His physical disabilities were pitiable. When he was
about thirty-three years old and shortly after his marriage,
he was standing in the Halle railway station
when a locomotive close by sounded its shrill whistle.
The effect upon him was like the piercing of his ears.
For several days afterward he heard nothing but confused
buzzing, and from that time on his hearing became
worse and worse, until finally his ears pained
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
him even when he composed. In 1876 he became
totally deaf, and a few years later his right arm was
paralyzed from shoulder to thumb. He was a poor
man, and right at the worst time in his life, when he
was totally deaf, a small pension which he had received
from the Bach Society was taken away from him. But
his admirers, many of them Americans, came to his
rescue and raised a fund for his support.</p>
<p>Among his finest songs are &ldquo;Widmung,&rdquo; &ldquo;Leise
Zieht durch mein Gemuht,&rdquo; &ldquo;Bitte,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Lotos
Blume,&rdquo; &ldquo;Es Ragt der Alte Eborus,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meerfahrt,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Das is ein Brausen und Heulen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ich Hab&rsquo; in Deinem
Auge,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ich Will meine seele Taugen,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Es Hat&rsquo;
Die Rose sich Beklagt.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Brahms a Thinker in Music.</h4>
<p>Brahms was a profound thinker in music&mdash;not a philosopher,
but a reflective poet, whose musicianship,
however, was so great that he cared too little for the
practical side of his art as compared with the theoretical.
If what he wrote looked all right on paper he
was indifferent as to whether it sounded right or not;
consequently, if he started out with a certain rhythmical
figuration or a certain scheme of harmonic progression,
he carried it through rigidly to its logical conclusion,
utterly oblivious to, or at least utterly regardless
of, any tonal blemishes that might result, although
by slightly altering his scheme here and there
he might have obviated these. This is the reason why
some people find passages in his music which to them
sound repellant. But those who have not allowed this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
aspect of Brahms&rsquo;s work to prejudice them and have
familiarized themselves with his music, well know that
he is one of the loftiest souls that ever put pen to
staff. He never is drastic, never sensational, never
superficial; and the climaxes of his songs, as in his
other music, are produced not by great outbursts of
sound, but by sudden modulations or change of rhythm,
which give a wonderful &ldquo;lift&rdquo; to voice and accompaniment.</p>
<p>Among his best known songs (and each of these is
a masterpiece) are: &ldquo;Wie Bist du meine Königin,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Ruhe, Süss Liebschen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Von ewiger Liebe,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wiegenlied,&rdquo; &ldquo;Minnelied,&rdquo; &ldquo;Feldeinsamkeit,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wie
Melodien zeiht es mir,&rdquo; &ldquo;Immer leiser wird mein
Schlummer,&rdquo; &ldquo;Meine Lieder,&rdquo; &ldquo;Wir wandelten, wir
Swei, zusammen.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>One of the most impassioned modern lyrical outbursts
is Jensen&rsquo;s setting of Heine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lehn deine Wang&rsquo;
an Meine Wang&rsquo;,&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Frühlingsnacht&rdquo; also is a
very beautiful song, although the popularity of Schumann&rsquo;s
setting of the same poem has cast it unduly into
the shade. Rubinstein will be found considerably less
prolix in his songs than in his music in other branches,
and those which he wrote to the Persian poems of
Von Bodenstedt (&ldquo;Mirza Schaffy&rdquo;) are fascinating
in their Oriental coloring. The &ldquo;Asra,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Yellow
Rolls at my Feet,&rdquo; (Gold Rollt mir zu Füssen) are
among the best known of these; while &ldquo;Es blink&rsquo;t der
Thau,&rdquo; &ldquo;Du Bist wie eine Blume,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Der Traum&rdquo;
are among Rubinstein&rsquo;s songs which are or should be
in the repertoire of every singer. Tschaikowsky and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
Dvorak are not noteworthy as song writers, but the
former&rsquo;s setting of &ldquo;Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt&rdquo;
and the latter&rsquo;s &ldquo;Gypsy Songs&rdquo; are highly successful.</p>
<h4>Grieg&rsquo;s Originality.</h4>
<p>One of the most fascinating among modern song
writers is the Norwegian, Grieg. He has been unusually
fortunate in having a fine singer as a wife.
Mr. Finck relates that Ibsen, after hearing her sing
his poems as set to music by Grieg, whispered as he
shook the hands of this musical couple, the one word,
&ldquo;Understood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grieg&rsquo;s originality has not been thoroughly appreciated,
because much of the beauty of his music has
been attributed to what is supposed to be its Norwegian
origin. Grieg is national, it is true, but not in a
cramped or narrow sense. His music is the product
of his individual genius, and his genius has made him
so popular that what is his has come to be wrongly
considered Norwegian, whereas it is Norway interpreted
through the genius of Grieg. His music is not
a dialect, but music of universal significance, fortunately
tinged with his individuality. &ldquo;I Love You,&rdquo;
Ibsen&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Swan,&rdquo; &ldquo;By the Riverside,&rdquo; &ldquo;Springtide,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Wounded Heart,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Mother Sings&rdquo; (a
mother mourning her dead child), &ldquo;At the Bier of a
Young Woman,&rdquo; and &ldquo;From Monte Pincio,&rdquo; are
among his finest <i>Lieder</i>.</p>
<p>Chopin is much too little known as a song writer.
His genius as a composer for the pianoforte has overshadowed
his songs, and the public is familiar with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
little else save &ldquo;The Maiden&rsquo;s Wish,&rdquo; which is one
of Madame Sembrich&rsquo;s favorite encores and to which
she plays her own accompaniment so delightfully. But
there is plenty of national color in the &ldquo;Lithuanina&rdquo;
song, plenty of pathos in &ldquo;Poland&rsquo;s Dirge,&rdquo; and plenty
of lyrical passion in &ldquo;My Delights.&rdquo; Finck says that
in all music, lyric or dramatic, the thrill of a kiss has
never been expressed so ecstatically as in the twelve
bars of this song marked &ldquo;<i>crescendo sempre piu accellerando</i>.&rdquo;
Certainly <i>sempre</i> (always) and <i>accellerando</i>
(faster) are capital words when applied to a
kiss!</p>
<p>Richard Wagner, when twenty-six years old, in
Paris, tried to relieve his poverty by composing a few
songs, among which is a very charming setting of
Ronsard&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dors mon enfant.&rdquo; He also set Heine&rsquo;s
&ldquo;The Two Grenadiers&rdquo; to music, utilizing the &ldquo;Marsellaise&rdquo;
in the accompaniment; but, as a whole, the Wagner
version of this poem is not as effective as Schumann&rsquo;s.
In 1862 he composed music to five poems
written by Mathilde Wesendonck, among which is the
famous &ldquo;Träume,&rdquo; which utilizes the theme of the love
duet that later on appeared in &ldquo;Tristan.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Liszt&rsquo;s Genius for Song.</h4>
<p>Liszt&rsquo;s songs are a complete musical exposition of
the poems to which they are composed. Thus while,
by way of comparison, Rubinstein&rsquo;s setting of &ldquo;Du
Bist wie eine Blume&rdquo; gives through its simplicity a
rare impression of purity, Liszt in his setting of the
same poem adds to that purity the sense of sacredness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span>
with which the contemplation of a pure woman fills a
man&rsquo;s heart and causes him to worship her. His &ldquo;Lorelei&rdquo;
is a beautiful lyric scene. We view the flowing
river, seem to hear the seductive voice of the temptress,
and watch the treacherous and stormy current that
hurries the ensnared boatman to his doom. And what
song has more of that valuable quality we call &ldquo;atmosphere&rdquo;
than Liszt&rsquo;s version of &ldquo;Kennst du das Land?&rdquo;
As will be the case with Liszt in other branches of
music, he will be recognized some day as one of the
greatest of song composers.</p>
<p>Richard Strauss&rsquo;s songs, from having been regarded
as so bristling with difficulties as to be impossible, have
become favorites in the song repertoire. When it is
a genius who creates difficulties these are sure to be
overcome by ambitious players and singers, and music
advances technically by just so much. Strauss&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Ständchen,&rdquo; with its deliciously delicate accompaniment,
so difficult to play with the requisite grace, was
the first of Strauss&rsquo;s songs to become popular here, and
it was the art of our great singer, Madame Nordica,
that made it so. Now we hear &ldquo;Die Nacht,&rdquo; &ldquo;Traum
durch die Dämmerung,&rdquo; &ldquo;Heimliche Aufforderung,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Allerseelem,&rdquo; &ldquo;Breit über mein Haupt Dein schwarzes
Haar,&rdquo; and many of his other songs with growing frequency.
There are few song composers with whom
the pianoforte accompaniment is so entirely distinct
from the melody (or so difficult to play), as often is
the case with Strauss. As with Schubert, every descriptive
suggestion contained in the poem is carried
into the accompaniment, but the vocal part is more
declamatory and more varied. Even now it seems certain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
that Strauss&rsquo;s songs are permanent acquisitions
to the repertoire. It still is too soon, however, to affirm
the same thing of the unfortunate Hugo Wolf&rsquo;s songs,
although I find myself strongly attracted by &ldquo;Er ists,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Frühling übers Jahr,&rdquo; &ldquo;Fussteise,&rdquo; &ldquo;Der König bei
der Kröning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gesang Weyla&rsquo;s,&rdquo; &ldquo;Elfenlied&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Der Tambour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saint-Saëns, Delibes, Godard, Massenet, Chaminade
and the late Augusta Holmès are among French song
writers whose work is clever, but who seem to me
more concerned with manner than with matter. Gounod&rsquo;s
rank as a song composer is much below his reputation
as the composer of &ldquo;Faust&rdquo; and &ldquo;Romeo et
Juliette.&rdquo; Oddly enough, however, the idea that came
to him of placing a melody above a prelude from Bach&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Well Tempered Clavichord&rdquo; did more than anything
he had accomplished up to that time to make him
famous. Originally he scored it for violin with a small
female chorus off stage. Then he replaced the chorus
with a harmonium. Finally he seems to have been
struck with the fact that the melody fitted the words
of the &ldquo;Ave Maria,&rdquo; substituted a single voice for the
violin, which, however, still can supplement the vocal
melody with an obbligato, did away with the harmonium,
and the result was the Gounod-Bach &ldquo;Ave
Maria.&rdquo; The Bach prelude, of course, sinks to the
level of a mere accompaniment, for it has to be taken
much slower than Bach intended.</p>
<p>American composers who have produced noteworthy
songs are Edward A. MacDowell, G. W. Chadwick,
Arthur Foote, Clayton Johns, Homer N. Bartlett, Margaret
Ruthven Lang, and the late Ethelbert Nevin.</p>

<a name='XV_ORATORIO' id='XV_ORATORIO'></a>
<h2>XV</h2>
<h3>ORATORIO</h3>
</div>
<p>Oratorio had its origin in an attempt by a
sixteenth century Italian monk to make divine
service more interesting&mdash;to draw to
church people who might not be attracted by the opportunity
to hear a sermon, but could be persuaded
to come if music a trifle more entertaining to the common
mind than the unaccompanied (<i>à capella</i>) ecclesiastical
compositions of Palestrina and other masters of
the polyphonic school, were thrown in with them.
Music still is regarded as a prime drawing card in
churches, and when nowadays a fine basso rises after
the sermon and sings &ldquo;It is enough,&rdquo; we can paraphrase
it as meaning, &ldquo;It is enough so far as the sermon
is concerned, and now to make up for it you are going
to have a chance to listen to some music.&rdquo; When the
announcement is made that such-and-such a well-known
singer has been engaged for a church it means
that the Reverend &mdash;&mdash; is doing just what the monk,
Neri, did, about four hundred years ago&mdash;fishing for a
congregation with music.</p>
<p>As it exists to-day, however, oratorio has little to do
with religious worship, and usually is practiced amid
secular surroundings, with a female chorus in variegated
evening attire and a male chorus in claw-hammers,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
the singers hanging more or less anxiously on
the baton of the conductor. This living picture which,
so far as this country is concerned, I have, I believe,
drawn in correct perspective, is so much out of keeping
with the religious subjects which usually underlie the
texts of oratorios that it may account for the comparative
lack of interest shown by Americans for this form
of musical entertainment.</p>
<p>It also is true, however, that in this country oratorio
never has had more than half a chance. This is
due to the fact that the American man is not as sensitive
to music nor musically as well educated as the
American woman, the result being that the male contingent
of the average American oratorio chorus is less
competent than the women singers. Tenors are &ldquo;rare
birds&rdquo; in any land, and rarer here apparently than elsewhere,
so that in this division of our mixed choruses
there is a lack of brilliancy in tone and of precision in
attack. These several circumstances combine to prevent
that well-balanced ensemble necessary to a satisfactory
performance.</p>
<h4>An Incongruous Art-Form.</h4>
<p>Even at its best, however, oratorio is an incongruous
art-form, neither an opera nor a church service, but
rather an attempt to design something that shall not
shock people who consider it &ldquo;wicked&rdquo; to go to the
opera, nor afflict with <i>ennui</i> those who would consider
an invitation to listen to sacred music during the week
an imposition. It seems peculiarly adapted to the idea
of entertainment which prevails in England, where apparently
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span>
any diversion in order to be considered legal
must be more or less of a bore. Fortunately, however,
there be many men of many minds; so that while, for
example, one could not well draw a gloomier picture
of the hereafter for a critic like Mr. Henry T. Finck
than as a place where he would be obliged to hear,
let me suggest, semi-weekly performances of &ldquo;The
Messiah,&rdquo; the annual Christmas auditions of that work
have been the financial salvation of oratorio in America.</p>
<p>San Filippo Neri, who was born in Florence in 1515,
and was the founder of the Congregation of the Fathers
of the Oratory, was the originator of oratorio. In order
to attract people to church, he instituted before and
after the sermon dramatic and musical renderings of
scenes from Scripture. It is not unlikely that the suggestion
for the underlying dramatic text came from
the old Mystery and Miracle plays, which, to say the
least, were naive. In one of these, representing Noah
and his family about to embark in the ark, <i>Mrs. Noah</i>
declares that she prefers to stay behind with her
worldly friends, and when at last her son <i>Shem</i> seizes
and forces her into the ark, she retaliates by giving the
worthy <i>Noah</i> a box on the ear. In another play of
this kind which represented the Creation, a horse, pigs
with rings in their noses, and a mastiff with a brass
collar were brought up to <i>Adam</i> to name. But in one
performance the mastiff spied a cow&rsquo;s rib-bone which
had been provided for the formation of <i>Eve</i>, grabbed
it and carried it off, in spite of the efforts of the <i>Angel</i>
to whistle him back, and <i>Eve</i> had to be created without
the aid of the rib.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span></div>
<h4>Primitive Efforts.</h4>
<p>It is not likely that any such contretemps accompanied
the performances of San Filippo&rsquo;s primitive oratorios,
and yet it is probable that they were not only
sung, but also acted with some kind of scenic setting
and costumes; for Emelio del Cavaliere, a
Roman composer, whose oratorio, &ldquo;La Rappresentazione
dell&rsquo; Anima e del Corpo&rdquo; (The Soul and the
Body), was performed in February, 1600, in the
Church of Santa Maria della Vallicella, but who died
before the production, left minute directions regarding
the scenery and action. In this oratorio, as in some
of the other early ones, there was a ballet, which, according
to its composer&rsquo;s directions, was to enliven certain
scenes &ldquo;with capers&rdquo; and to execute others &ldquo;sedately
and reverentially.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the composer, Giovanni Carissimi, who first
introduced the narrator in oratorio, this function being
to continue the action with explanatory recitatives between
the numbers. In his oratorio, &ldquo;Jephtha,&rdquo; there
is a solo for Jephtha&rsquo;s daughter, &ldquo;Plorate colles, dolate
montes&rdquo; (Weep, ye hills; mourn, ye mountains), which
has an echo for two sopranos at the end of each phrase
of the melody. Alessandro Scarlatti, who developed
the aria in opera, also gave more definite form to the
solos in oratorio and a more dramatic accompaniment
to the recitatives which related to action, leaving the
narrative recitals unaccompanied.</p>
<p>Up to this point, in fact, oratorio and opera may
be said to have developed hand in hand, but now,
through the influence of German composers and especially
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
through their Passion Music, it assumed a more
distinct form. &ldquo;Die Auferstehung Christi&rdquo; (The Resurrection),
by Heinrich Schütz, produced in Dresden
in 1623, and his &ldquo;Sieben Worte Christi&rdquo; (The Seven
Words of Christ), subjects which have been reverentially
set by many German composers, are regarded
as pioneer works of their kind. In the development
of Passion Music much use was made of church
chorales, the grand sacred melodies of the German
people, which have had incalculable influence in forming
the stability of character that is a distinguishing
mark of the race. They are conspicuous in the &ldquo;Tod
Jesu,&rdquo; a famous work by Karl Heinrich Graun, a contemporary
of Bach, whose own &ldquo;Passion According
to St. Matthew&rdquo; is regarded by advanced lovers of
music as the greatest of all works in oratorio or quasi-oratorio
style, although the English still cling to
Händel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However close the imitation or complicated the involutions
of the several voices,&rdquo; says Rockstro, in writing
of Händel, &ldquo;we never meet with an inharmonious
collision. He (Händel) seems always to have aimed
at making his parts run on velvet; whereas Bach, writing
on a totally different principle, evidently delighted
in bringing harmony out of discord and made a point
of introducing hard passing notes in order to avail
himself of the pleasant effect of their ultimate resolution.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;inharmonious collisions,&rdquo; the &ldquo;hard
passing notes&rdquo; are among the very things which make
Bach so modern; since modern ears do not set much
store by music that &ldquo;runs on velvet.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<h4>Bach&rsquo;s &ldquo;Passion Music.&rdquo;</h4>
<p>It is interesting to note that this &ldquo;Passion According
to St. Matthew&rdquo; is in two parts, and that, as was the
case with the oratorios of San Filippo Neri, the sermon
came between. The text was prepared by Christian
Friedrichs Henrici, writing under the pseudonym of
Picander, and is partly dramatic, partly epic in form,
with an Evangelist to relate the various events in
the story, but with the Lord, St. Peter and others
using their own words according to the sacred
text. A double chorus is employed, sometimes
representing the Disciples, sometimes the infuriated
populace; but always treated in dramatic
fashion.</p>
<p>At the time the &ldquo;Passion&rdquo; was written, the arias and
certain of the choruses which contained meditations on
the events narrated were called &ldquo;Soliloqui&aelig;&rdquo;; and in
singing the beautiful chorales, the congregation was
expected to join. The recitatives assigned to the Saviour
are accompanied by string orchestra only, and are,
as Rockstro says, full of gentle dignity, while the choruses
are marked by an amount of dramatic power which
is remarkable when one considers that Bach never paid
any attention to the most dramatic of all musical forms,
the opera. The &ldquo;Passion According to St. Matthew,&rdquo;
by Johann Sebastian Bach, was his greatest work and
one of the greatest works of all times. It was produced
for the first time at the afternoon service in the Church
of St. Thomas, Leipzig, where Bach was Cantor, on
Good Friday, 1729, and it was one hundred years before
it was heard again, when it was revived by Mendelssohn,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
in Berlin, on March 12th, 1829&mdash;an epoch-making
performance.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Passion Music is not an oratorio,
but a church service, and Bach actually designed his
to serve as a counter-attraction to the Mass as performed
in the Roman Church. What we understand
under oratorio derived its vitality from George Frederick
Händel, who was born at Halle in Lower Saxony,
1685, but whose most important work was accomplished
in London, where he died in 1759 and was
buried in Westminster Abbey. Before Händel wrote
his two greatest oratorios, &ldquo;Israel in Egypt&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Messiah,&rdquo; he had, through the composition of numerous
operas, mastered the principles of dramatic writing,
and in his oratorios he aims, whenever the text makes
it permissible, at dramatic expression. It is only necessary
to recall the &ldquo;Plague Choruses&rdquo; in &ldquo;Israel in
Egypt,&rdquo; especially the &ldquo;Hail-Stone Chorus&rdquo; and the
chorus of rejoicing (&ldquo;The horse and his rider hath He
thrown into the sea&rdquo;); or by way of contrast, the tenderly
expressive melody of &ldquo;As for His people, He led
them forth like sheep,&rdquo; to realize what an adept Händel
was in dramatic expression.</p>
<h4>Rockstro on Händel.</h4>
<p>Händel may in fact be called the founder of variety
and freedom in writing for chorus. While I must confess
that I do not share Rockstro&rsquo;s intense enthusiasm
for Händel and for &ldquo;The Messiah,&rdquo; nevertheless he expresses
so well the general feeling in England and the
feeling on the part of those in this country who crowd
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
the annual Christmas performances of &ldquo;The Messiah,&rdquo;
toward that work, that the best means of conveying an
idea of what oratorio signifies to those who like it, is
to quote him. Referring to Händel&rsquo;s free and varied
treatment of chorus writing, he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He bids us &lsquo;Behold the Lamb of God&rsquo; and we feel
that he has helped us to do so. He tells us that &lsquo;With
His stripes we are healed,&rsquo; and we are sensible not
of the healing only, but of the cruel price at which it
was purchased. And we yield him equal obedience
when he calls upon us to join in his hymns of praise.
Who hearing the noble subject of &lsquo;I will sing unto the
Lord,&rsquo; led off by the tenors and altos, does not long
to reinforce their voices with his own? Who does not
feel a choking in his throat before the first bar of the
&lsquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rsquo; is completed, though he may be
listening to it for the hundredth time? Hard indeed
must his heart be who can refuse to hear when Händel
preaches through the voice of his chorus.&rdquo; The &ldquo;Messiah&rdquo;
also contains two of Händel&rsquo;s most famous solos,
&ldquo;He shall feed His flock&rdquo; and &ldquo;I know that my Redeemer
liveth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This work was performed for the first time on April
13, 1742, at the Music Hall, Dublin, when Händel was
on a visit to the Duke of Devonshire, then Lord Lieutenant
of Ireland. The rehearsals, at which many
people were present by invitation, had aroused so much
enthusiasm, that those who were interested in the charitable
object for which it was given, requested &ldquo;as a
favor that the ladies who honor this performance with
their presence would be pleased to come without hoops,
as it would greatly increase the charity by making room
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
for more company.&rdquo; Gentlemen also were requested
to come without swords, for the same reason. It is
said that at the first London performance, when the
&ldquo;Hallelujah Chorus&rdquo; rang out, the King rose in his
place and, followed by the entire audience, stood during
the singing of the chorus, and that thus the custom,
which still is observed, originated.</p>
<p>Following Händel, Haydn in 1798, when nearly seventy
years old, wrote &ldquo;The Creation,&rdquo; founded on
passages from Milton&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradise Lost,&rdquo; and after it
&ldquo;The Seasons,&rdquo; for which Thomson&rsquo;s familiar poem
supplied the text. In both of these there is much
purely descriptive music, especially in the earlier oratorio,
when the creation of various animals is related.
In &ldquo;The Creation,&rdquo; too, after the passages for muted
strings, is the famous outburst of orchestra and chorus,
&ldquo;And there was light.&rdquo; Haydn was a far greater master
of orchestration than Händel. He also was one of the
early composers of the homophonic school, and there is a
freer, more spontaneous flow of melody in his oratorios.
But they undoubtedly lack the grandeur of Händel&rsquo;s.</p>
<h4>Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Oratorios.</h4>
<p>Between Haydn and Mendelssohn, in the development
of oratorio, nothing need be mentioned, excepting
Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mount of Olives&rdquo; and Spohr&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Last
Judgment&rdquo; (Die Letzten Dinge). Mendelssohn, in
his &ldquo;St. Paul,&rdquo; followed the example of the old passionists,
and introduced chorales, but in his greater
oratorio, &ldquo;Elijah,&rdquo; which is purely an Hebraic subject,
he discarded these. The dramatic quality of &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
is so apparent that it has been said more than once to
be capable of stage representation with scenery, costumes
and action. This is especially true of the prophet
himself, whose personality is so definitely developed
that he stands before us almost like a character behind
the footlights. This dramatic value is felt at the very
beginning, when, after four solemn chords on the brass,
the work, instead of opening with an overture, is ushered
in by <i>Elijah&rsquo;s</i> prophecy of the drought. Then
comes the overture, which is descriptive of the effects
of the prophecy.</p>
<p>Next to &ldquo;The Messiah,&rdquo; &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; probably is the
most popular of oratorios, and I think this is due to
its dramatic value, and to the fact that its descriptive
music, instead of being somewhat naive, not to say
childish, as is the case with some passages in Haydn&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Creation,&rdquo; is extremely effective. It is necessary only
to remind the reader of the descent of the fire and
the destruction of the prophets of Baal; of the description
of the gradual approach of the rain-storm, as
<i>Elijah</i>, standing on Mount Carmel and watching for
the coming of the rain, is informed of the little cloud,
&ldquo;out of the sea, like a man&rsquo;s hand&rdquo;&mdash;a little cloud which
we seem to see in the music, and which grows in size
and blackness until it bursts like a deluge over the
scene. Then there are the famous bass solo, &ldquo;It is
enough&rdquo;; the unaccompanied &ldquo;Trio of Angels&rdquo;; the
<i>Angel&rsquo;s</i> song, &ldquo;Oh, rest in the Lord&rdquo;; and the tenderly
expressive chorus, &ldquo;He, watching over Israel.&rdquo; I once
heard a performance of &ldquo;Elijah&rdquo; during which the
<i>Angel</i> carried on such a lively flirtation with the
<i>Prophet</i> that she almost missed the cue for her most
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
important solo; in fact would have missed it, had not
the conductor sharply called her attention to the fact
that it was time for her to begin.</p>
<p>I think that oratorio reached its successive climaxes
with &ldquo;The Messiah&rdquo; and &ldquo;Elijah.&rdquo; Gounod&rsquo;s &ldquo;Redemption&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Mors et Vita,&rdquo; in spite of passages of
undeniable beauty, seem to me, as a whole, rather spineless.
Edward Elgar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dream of Gerontius&rdquo; and
&ldquo;The Apostles&rdquo; have created much excitement in England
and considerable interest here, but while it is too
soon to hazard a definite opinion of this composer, he
appears to be lacking in individuality&mdash;to derive from
Wagner whatever is interesting in his scores, while
what is original with him is unimportant.</p>
<p>There are certain sacred, semi-sacred and even secular
works that are apt to figure on the programs of
oratorio and allied societies. Mr. Frank Damrosch&rsquo;s
Society of Musical Art sings very beautifully some of
the unaccompanied choruses of the early Italian polyphonic
school, such as Palestrina&rsquo;s &ldquo;Papae Marcelli
Mass,&rdquo; &ldquo;Stabat Mater&rdquo; and &ldquo;Requiem&rdquo;; the &ldquo;Miserere&rdquo;
of Allegri (sought to be retained exclusively by
the choir of the Sistine Chapel, but which Mozart wrote
out from memory after hearing it twice); and the
&ldquo;Stabat Mater&rdquo; of Pergolesi. There are also the Bach
cantatas, Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Requiem,&rdquo; with its tragic associations;
Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mass in D;&rdquo; Schumann&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paradise
and the Peri&rdquo; and his music to Byron&rsquo;s &ldquo;Manfred&rdquo;
(with recitation); Liszt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Graner Mass,&rdquo; &ldquo;Legend of
St. Elizabeth&rdquo; and &ldquo;Christus&rdquo;; Rubinstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tower of
Babel&rdquo; and &ldquo;Paradise Lost&rdquo;; Brahms&rsquo;s &ldquo;German Requiem,&rdquo;
a noble but difficult work; Dvorak&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stabat
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
Mater&rdquo;; Rossini&rsquo;s &ldquo;Moses in Egypt&rdquo; and &ldquo;Stabat
Mater&rdquo;; Berlioz&rsquo;s &ldquo;Requiem&rdquo; and &ldquo;Damnation de
Faust,&rdquo; the American production of which latter was
one of the late Dr. Leopold Damrosch&rsquo;s finest achievements;
and Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Manzoni Requiem.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>XVI</h2>
<h3>OPERA AND MUSIC-DRAMA</h3>
</div>
<p>Opera originated in Florence toward the close
of the sixteenth century. A band of enthusiastic,
intellectual composers aimed at reproducing the
musical declamation which they believed to
have been characteristic of the representation of Greek
tragedy. The first attempt resulted in a cantata, &ldquo;Il
Conte Ugolino,&rdquo; for single voice with the accompaniment
of a single instrument, and composed by Vincenzo
Galileo, father of the famous astronomer. Another
composer, Giulio Caccini, wrote several shorter
pieces in similar style.</p>
<p>These composers aimed at an exact oratorical rendering
of the words. Consequently, their scores were
neither fugal nor in any other sense polyphonic, but
strictly monodic. They were not, however, melodious,
but declamatory; and if Richard Wagner had wished,
in the nineteenth century, to claim any historical foundation
for the declamatory recitative which he introduced
in his music-dramas, he might have fallen back
upon these composers of the late sixteenth and early
seventeenth centuries, and through them back to Greek
tragedy with its bands of lyres and flutes.</p>
<p>These Italian composers, then, were the creators of
recitative, so different from the polyphonic church
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span>
music of the school of Palestrina. What usually is
classed as the first opera, Jacopo Peri&rsquo;s &ldquo;Dafne,&rdquo; was
privately performed at the Palazzo Corsi, Florence, in
1597. So great was its success that Peri was commissioned,
in 1600, to write a similar work for the festivities
incidental to the marriage of Henry IV of France
with Maria de Medici, and produced &ldquo;Euridice,&rdquo; the
first Italian opera ever performed in public.</p>
<p>The new art-form received great stimulus from
Claudio Monteverde, the Duke of Mantua&rsquo;s <i>maestro di
capella</i>, who composed &ldquo;Arianna&rdquo; in honor of the marriage
of Francesco Gonzaga with Margherita, Infanta
of Savoy. The scene in which <i>Ariadne</i> bewails her
desertion by her lover was so dramatically written
(from the standpoint of the day, of course) that it produced
a sensation, and when Monteverde brought out
with even greater success his opera &ldquo;Orfeo,&rdquo; which
showed a great advance in dramatic expression, as well
as in the treatment of the instrumental score, the permanency
of opera was assured.</p>
<p>Monteverde&rsquo;s scores contained, besides recitative,
suggestions of melody, but these suggestions occurred
only in the instrumental ritornelles. The Venetian
composer Cavalli, however, introduced melody into the
vocal score in order to relieve the monotonous effect of
continuous recitative, and in his airs for voice he foreshadowed
the aria form which was destined to be freely
developed by Alessandro Scarlatti, who is regarded as
the founder of modern Italian opera in the form in
which it flourished from his day to and including the
earlier period of Verdi&rsquo;s activity.</p>
<p>Melody, free and beautiful melody, soaring above a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
comparatively simple accompaniment, was the characteristic
of Italian opera from Scarlatti&rsquo;s first opera,
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Onesta nell&rsquo; Amore,&rdquo; produced in Rome in 1680, to
Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Trovatore,&rdquo; produced in the same city in 1853.
The names, besides Verdi&rsquo;s, associated with its most
brilliant successes, are: Rossini (&ldquo;Il Barbiere di Siviglia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Guillaume Tell&rdquo;), Bellini (&ldquo;Norma,&rdquo; &ldquo;La
Sonnambula,&rdquo; &ldquo;I Puritani&rdquo;), and Donizetti (&ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo;
&ldquo;L&rsquo;Elisir d&rsquo;Amore,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Fille du Regiment&rdquo;). These
composers possessed dramatic verve to a great degree,
aimed straight for the mark, and when at their best
always hit the operatic target in the bull&rsquo;s-eye.</p>
<h4>Reforms by Gluck.</h4>
<p>The charge most frequently laid against Italian
opera is that its composers have been too subservient
to the singers, and have sacrificed dramatic truth and
depth of expression, as well as the musicianship which
is required of a well-written and well-balanced score,
as between the vocal and instrumental portions, to the
vanity of those upon the stage&mdash;in brief, that Italian
opera consists too much of show-pieces for its interpreters.
Among the first to protest practically against
this abuse was Gluck, a German, who, from copying
the Italian style of operatic composition early in his
career, changed his entire method as late as 1762, when
he was nearly fifty years old. &ldquo;Orfeo et Euridice,&rdquo; the
oldest opera that to-day still holds a place in the operatic
repertoire, and containing the favorite air, &ldquo;Che
faro senza Euridice&rdquo; (I have lost my Eurydice), was
produced by Gluck, in Vienna, in the year mentioned.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
There Gluck followed it up with &ldquo;Alceste,&rdquo; then went
to Paris, and scored a triumph with &ldquo;Iphigenie en Aulite.&rdquo;
But on the arrival, in Paris, of the Italian
composer, Piccini, the Italian party there seized upon
him as a champion to pit against Gluck, and there then
ensued in the French capital a rivalry so fierce that
it became a veritable musical War of the Roses until
Gluck completely triumphed over Piccini with &ldquo;Iphigenie
en Tauride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gluck&rsquo;s reform of opera lay in his abandoning all
effort at claptrap effect&mdash;effect merely for its own sake&mdash;and
in making his choruses as well as his soloists participants,
musically and actively, in the unfolding of the
dramatic story. But while he avoided senseless vocal
embellishments and ceased to make a display of singers&rsquo;
talents the end and purpose of opera, he never hesitated
to introduce beautiful melody for the voice when the action
justified it. In fact, what he aimed at was dramatic
truth in his music, and with this end in view he
also gave greater importance to the instrumental portion
of his score.</p>
<h4>Comparative Popularity of Certain Operas.</h4>
<p>These characteristics remained for many years to
come the distinguishing marks of German opera. They
will be discovered in Mozart&rsquo;s &ldquo;Nozze di Figaro,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; and &ldquo;Zauberflöte,&rdquo; which differ from
Gluck&rsquo;s operas in not being based on heroic or classical
subjects, and in exhibiting the general advance made
in freer musical expression, as well as Mozart&rsquo;s greater
spontaneity of melodic invention, his keen sense of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
dramatic element and his superior skill in orchestration.
They also will be discovered in Beethoven&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fidelio,&rdquo;
which again differs from Mozart&rsquo;s operas in the same
degree in which the individuality of one great composer
differs from that of another. With Weber&rsquo;s &ldquo;Freischütz,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Euryanthe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Oberon,&rdquo; German opera enters
upon the romantic period, from which it is but a
step to the &ldquo;Flying Dutchman,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tannhäuser,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; and the music-dramas of Richard
Wagner.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the French had developed a style of
opera of their own, which is represented by Meyerbeer&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Les Huguenots,&rdquo; Gounod&rsquo;s &ldquo;Faust,&rdquo; apparently destined
to live as long as any opera that now graces the
stage, and by Bizet&rsquo;s absolutely unique &ldquo;Carmen.&rdquo; In
French opera the instrumental support of the voices is
far richer and more delicately discriminating than in
Italian opera, and the whole form is more serious. It
is better thought out, shows greater intellectual effort
and not such a complete abandon to absolute musical
inspiration. It is true, there is much claptrap in Meyerbeer,
but &ldquo;Les Huguenots&rdquo; still lives&mdash;and vitality
is, after all, the final test of an art-work.</p>
<p>Unquestionably, Italian operas like &ldquo;Il Barbiere di
Siviglia,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Sonnambula,&rdquo; &ldquo;Lucia,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trovatore&rdquo;
are more popular in this country than Mozart&rsquo;s
or Weber&rsquo;s operatic works. In assigning reasons for
this it seems generally to be forgotten that these Italian
operas are far more modern. &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; was
produced in 1787, whereas &ldquo;Il Barbiere&rdquo; was brought
out in 1816, &ldquo;La Sonnambula&rdquo; in 1831, &ldquo;Lucia&rdquo; in
1835, &ldquo;Trovatore&rdquo; in 1853 and Verdi&rsquo;s last work in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
operatic style, &ldquo;Aida,&rdquo; in 1871. &ldquo;Don Giovanni&rdquo; still
employs the dry recitative (recitatives accompanied by
simple chords on the violoncello), which is exceedingly
tedious and makes the work drag at many points. In
&ldquo;Il Barbiere,&rdquo; although the recitatives are musically as
uninteresting, they are humorous, and, with Italian
buffos, trip lightly and vivaciously from the tongue.
As regards &ldquo;Fidelio&rdquo; and &ldquo;Der Freischütz,&rdquo; the
amount of spoken dialogue in them is enough to keep
these works off the American stage, or at least to prevent
them from becoming popular here.</p>
<p>Wagner has had far-reaching effect upon music in
general, and even Italian opera, which, of all art-forms,
was least like his music-dramas, has felt his influence.
Boito&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mefistofele,&rdquo; Ponchielli&rsquo;s &ldquo;La Gioconda,&rdquo;
Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Otello&rdquo; and &ldquo;Falstaff,&rdquo; are examples
of the far-reaching results of Wagner&rsquo;s theories. Even
in &ldquo;Aida,&rdquo; Verdi&rsquo;s more discriminating treatment of
the orchestral score and his successful effort to give
genuine Oriental color to at least some portions of it,
show that even then he was beginning to weary of
the cheaper successes he had won with operas like &ldquo;Il
Trovatore,&rdquo; &ldquo;La Traviata&rdquo; and &ldquo;Rigoletto,&rdquo; and, while
by no means inclined to menace his own originality by
copying Wagner or by adopting his system, was willing
to profit by the more serious attitude of Wagner toward
his art. Puccini, in &ldquo;La Tosca,&rdquo; has written a first-act
finale which is palpably constructed on Wagnerian
lines. In his &ldquo;La Bohême,&rdquo; in Leoncavallo&rsquo;s &ldquo;I Pagliacci&rdquo;
and in Mascagni&rsquo;s &ldquo;Cavalleria Rusticana,&rdquo; the
distinct efforts made to have the score reflect the characteristics
of the text show Wagner&rsquo;s influence potent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
in the most modern phases of Italian opera. Humperdinck&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Hänsel und Gretel&rdquo; and Richard Strauss&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Feuersnot&rdquo; and &ldquo;Salome&rdquo; represent the further working
out of Wagner&rsquo;s art-form in Germany.</p>
<h4>Wagner&rsquo;s Music-Dramas.</h4>
<p>I doubt whether Wagner had either the Greek
drama or the declamatory recitative of the early
Italian opera composers in mind when he originated
the music-drama. My opinion is that he thought
it out free from any extraneous suggestion, but afterward,
anticipating the attacks which in the then state
of music in Germany would be made upon his theories,
sought for prototypes and found them in ancient Greece
and renascent Italy.</p>
<p>His theory of dramatic music is that it should express
with undeviating fidelity the words which underly
it; not words in their mere outward aspect, but
their deeper significance in their relation to the persons,
controlling ideas, impulses and passions out of which
grow the scenes, situations, climaxes and crises of the
written play, the libretto, if so you choose to call it&mdash;so
long as you don&rsquo;t say &ldquo;book of the opera.&rdquo; For
even from this brief characterization, it must be patent
that a music-drama is not an opera, but what opera
should be or would be had it not, through the Italian
love of clearly defined melody and the Italian admiration
for beautiful singing, become a string of solos,
duets and other &ldquo;numbers&rdquo; written in set form to the
detriment of the action.</p>
<p>Opera is the glorification of the voice and the deification
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
of the singer.&mdash;Do we not call the prima donna a
<i>diva</i>? Music-drama, on the other hand, is the glorification
of music in its broadest sense, instrumental and
vocal combined, and the deification of dramatic truth
on the musical stage. Opera, as handled by the Italian
and the French, undoubtedly is a very attractive art-form,
but music-drama is a higher art-form, because
more serious and more searching and more elevated in
its expression of emotion.</p>
<p>Wagner was German to the core&mdash;as national as
Luther, says Mr. Krehbiel most aptly, in his &ldquo;Studies
in the Wagnerian Drama,&rdquo; which, like everything this
critic writes, is the work of a thinker. For the dramas
which Wagner created as the bases for his scores, he
went back to legends which, if not always Teutonic in
their origin, had become steeped in Germanism. The
profound impression made by Wagner&rsquo;s art works may
be indicated by saying that the whole folk-lore movement
dates from his activity, and that so far as Germany
itself is concerned, his argument for a national
art work as well as his practical illustration of what
he meant through his own music-dramas, gave immense
impetus to the development of united Germany as manifested
in the German empire. He as well as the men
of blood and iron had a share in Sedan.</p>
<p>Wagner&rsquo;s first successful work, &ldquo;Rienzi,&rdquo; was an
out-and-out opera in Meyerbeerian style. The &ldquo;Flying
Dutchman&rdquo; already is legendary and more serious,
while &ldquo;Tannhäuser&rdquo; and &ldquo;Lohengrin&rdquo; show immense
technical progress, besides giving a clue to his system
of leading motives, which is fully developed in the
scores of the &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung,&rdquo; &ldquo;Tristan und
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
Isolde,&rdquo; &ldquo;Die Meistersinger,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Parsifal.&rdquo; That
his theories met with a storm of opposition and that
for many years the battle between Wagnerism and anti-Wagnerism
raged with unabated vigor in the musical
world, are matters of history. Whoever wishes to explore
this phase of Wagner&rsquo;s career will find it set forth
in the most interesting Wagner biography in any language,
Mr. Finck&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wagner and His Works.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Wagner a Melodist.</h4>
<p>It sometimes is contended that Wagner adopted his
system of leading motives because he was not a melodist.
This is refuted by the melodies that abound in his
earlier works; and, even as I write, I can hear the pupils
in a nearby public school singing the melody of the
&ldquo;Pilgrim&rsquo;s Chorus&rdquo; from &ldquo;Tannhäuser.&rdquo; Moreover, his
leading motives themselves are descriptively or soulfully
melodious as the requirement may be. They are
brief phrases, it is true, but none the less they are melodies.
And, in certain episodes in his music-dramas,
when he deemed it permissible, he introduced beautiful
melodies that are complete in themselves: <i>Siegmund&rsquo;s</i>
&ldquo;Love Song&rdquo; and <i>Wotan&rsquo;s</i> &ldquo;Farewell,&rdquo; in &ldquo;Die
Walküre,&rdquo; the Love Duet at the end of &ldquo;Siegfried,&rdquo;
the love scene in &ldquo;Tristan und Isolde,&rdquo; the Prize Song
in &ldquo;Die Meistersinger.&rdquo; The eloquence of the brief
melodious phrases which we call leading motives, considered
by themselves alone and without any reference
to the dramatic situation, must be clear to any one who
has heard the Funeral March in &ldquo;Götterdämmerung,&rdquo;
which consists entirely of a series of leading motives
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
that have occurred earlier in the Cycle, yet give this
passage an overpowering pathos without equal in absolute
music and just as effective whether you know the
story of the music-drama and the significance of the
motives, or not. If you do know the story and the significance
of these musical phrases, you will find that in
this Funeral March the whole &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung&rdquo;
is being summed up for you, and coming as it does
near the end of &ldquo;Götterdämmerung,&rdquo; but one scene intervening
between it and the final curtain, it gives a
wonderful sense of unity to the whole work.</p>
<p>Unity is, in fact, a distinguishing trait of music-drama;
and the very term &ldquo;unity&rdquo; suggests that certain
recurring salient points in the drama, whether they
be personages, ideas or situations, should be treated
musically with a certain similarity, and have certain
recognizable characteristics. In fact, the adaptation of
music to a drama would seem to suggest association of
ideas through musical unity, and to presuppose the employment
of something like leading motives. They
had indeed been used tentatively by Berlioz in orchestral
music, and by Weber in opera (&ldquo;Euryanthe&rdquo;), but
it remained for Wagner to work up the suggestion into
a complete and consistent system.</p>

<p>To illustrate his method, take the Curse Motive, in
the &ldquo;Ring of the Nibelung,&rdquo; which is heard when <i>Alberich</i>
curses the Ring, and all into whose possession it
shall come. When, near the end of &ldquo;Rheingold,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
<i>Fafner</i> kills his brother, <i>Fasolt</i>, in wresting the Ring
from him, the motive recurs with a significance which
is readily understood. <i>Fasolt</i> is the first victim of the
curse. Again, in &ldquo;Götterdämmerung,&rdquo; when <i>Siegfried</i>
lands at the entrance to the castle of <i>Gibichungs</i>,
and is greeted by <i>Hagen</i>, although the greeting seems
hearty enough, the motive is heard and conveys its
sinister lure.</p>

<p>When, in &ldquo;Die Walküre,&rdquo; <i>Brünnhilde</i> predicts the
birth of a son to <i>Sieglinde</i>, you hear the Siegfried Motive,
signifying that the child will be none other than
the young hero of the next drama. The motive is
heard again when <i>Wotan</i> promises <i>Brünnhilde</i> to surround
her with a circle of flames which none but a hero
can penetrate, <i>Siegfried</i> being that hero; and also when
<i>Siegfried</i> himself, in the music-drama &ldquo;Siegfried,&rdquo; tells
of seeing his image in the brook.</p>

<p>There are motives which are almost wholly rhythmical,
like the &ldquo;Nibelung&rdquo; Smithy Motive, which depicts
the slavery of the <i>Nibelungs</i>, eternally working in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
mines of Nibelheim; and motives with strange, weird
harmonies, like the motive of the Tarnhelm, which conveys
a sense of mystery, the Tarnhelm giving its
wearer the power to change his form.</p>

<h4>Leading Motives not Mere Labels.</h4>
<p>Leading motives are not mere labels. They concern
themselves with more than the superficial aspect of
things and persons. With persons they express character;
with things they symbolize what these stand for.
The Curse Motive is weird, sinister. You feel when
listening to it that it bodes evil to all who come within
its dark circle. The Siegfried Motive, on the other
hand, is buoyant with youth, vigor, courage; vibrates
with the love of achievement; and stirs the soul with
its suggestion of heroism. But when you hear it in
the Funeral March in &ldquo;Götterdämmerung&rdquo; and it recalls
by association the gay-hearted, tender yet courageous
boy, who slew the dragon, awakened <i>Brünnhilde</i>
with his kiss, only to be betrayed and murdered by
<i>Hagen</i>, and now is being borne over the mountain to
the funeral pyre, those heroic strains have a tragic
significance that almost brings tears to your eyes.</p>
<p>The Siegfried Motive is a good example of a musical
phrase the contour of which practically remains unchanged
through the music-drama. The varied emotions
with which we listen to it are effected by association.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
But many of Wagner&rsquo;s leading motives are extremely
plastic and undergo many changes in illustrating
the development of character or the special bearing
of certain dramatic situations upon those concerned in
the action of the drama. As a gay-hearted youth,
<i>Siegfried</i> winds his horn:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_11' id='linki_11'></a>
</div>
<a href='images/big_illus-272a.png'>

</a>
<p class='caption'>
[<a href="music/272a.mid">Listen</a>]<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>This horn call becomes, when, as <i>Brünnhilde&rsquo;s</i> husband,
he bids farewell to his bride and departs in quest of
knightly adventure, the stately Motive of <i>Siegfried</i>, the
Hero:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_12' id='linki_12'></a>
</div>
<a href='images/big_illus-272b.png'>
<img src='images/illus-272b.png' alt='' title='' width='500' height='74' /><br />
</a>
<p class='caption'>
[<a href="music/272b.mid">Listen</a>]<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>And when the dead <i>Siegfried</i>, stretched upon a
rude bier, is borne from the scene, it voices the climax
of the tragedy with overwhelming power:</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<div class='figtag'>
<a name='linki_13' id='linki_13'></a>
</div>
<a href='images/big_illus-272c.png'>

</a>
<p class='caption'>
[<a href="music/272c.mid">Listen</a>]<br />
</p>
</div>
<p>Thus we have two derivatives from the &ldquo;Siegfried&rdquo;
horn call, each with its own special significance, yet
harking back to the original germ.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>Soon after the opening of &ldquo;Tristan und Isolde&rdquo; a
sailor sings an unaccompanied song of farewell to his
<i>Irish Maid</i>. The words, &ldquo;The wind blows freshly
toward our home,&rdquo; are sung to an undulating phrase
which seems to represent the gentle heaving of the sea.</p>

<p>This same phrase gracefully undulates through <i>Brangäne&rsquo;s</i>
reply to <i>Isolde&rsquo;s</i> question as to the vessel&rsquo;s
course, changes entirely in character, and surges savagely
around her wild outburst of anger when she is
told that the vessel is nearing Cornwall&rsquo;s shore, and
breaks itself in savage fury against her despairing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
wrath when she invokes the elements to destroy the
ship and all upon it. Examples like these occur many
times in the scores of Wagner&rsquo;s music-dramas.</p>

<p>Often, when several characters are participating in a
scene, or when the act or influence of one, or the principle
for which he stands in the drama, is potent, though
he himself is not present, Wagner with rare skill combines
several motives, utilizing for this purpose all the
resources of counterpoint. Elsewhere I already have
described how he has done this in the Magic Fire
Scene in &ldquo;Die Walküre,&rdquo; and one could add page after
page of examples of this kind. I have also spoken of
his supreme mastership of instrumentation, through
which he gives an endless variety of tone color to his
score.</p>
<p>Wagner was a great dramatist, but he was a far
greater musician. There are many splendid scenes and
climaxes in the dramas which he wrote for his music,
and if he had not been a composer it is possible he would
have achieved immortality as a writer of tragedy. On
the other hand, however, there are in his dramas many
long stretches in which the action is unconsciously delayed
by talk. He believed that music and drama
should go hand in hand and each be of equal interest;
but his supreme musicianship has disproved his own
theories, for his dramas derive the breath of life from
his music. Theoretically, he is not supposed to have
written absolute music&mdash;music for its own sake&mdash;but
music that would be intelligible and interesting only in
connection with the drama to which it was set. But
the scores of the great scenes in his music-dramas,
played simply as instrumental selections in concert and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span>
without the slightest clue to their meaning in their
given place, constitute the greatest achievements in
absolute music that history up to the present time can
show.</p>
